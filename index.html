                <h3>一部跨文化视角下当代女性成长小说</h3><h3> 张赟著</h3>

章节节选，本书将于2025年3月由世界华文出版社出版

 <h3>前言</h3>

世界需要流动，否则偏见与隔阂更盛。行走世界的人是文
化交流的毛细。他们用肉身连接其他文明，消弭对立，守
护和平。
				<br><br><br>
成长和探索是人的本能需求，跟吃喝拉撒繁衍一样，是基
础欲望。也是青春期和中年危机产生的原因。
				<br><br><br>
人与人之间长期关系的基础是劳务交换，大到国家小到家
庭，无非就是取长补短、相互协作。
				<br><br><br>
故事像匹诺曹，按人的样子做出来，你以为它是个木偶，
但它一有眉眼就产生独立意志，情节的发展，说的话和做
的决定，是自然发生的，控制不了一点。
				<br><br><br>
这是一个故事。如有相似，无需对号入座。
<br><br><br>

<h3> 1.奇怪的女人</h3>
雅典夏天风大，又干燥，天上存不住云。偶尔有点水汽蒸
腾到天上变成孤零零的一朵云，你能眼巴巴的看着它一点
一点没了，就跟水写毛笔字一样。
				<br><br><br>
山上也存不住树。顶多零零碎碎长点马基灌丛。比方说橄
榄树。橄榄树长得颇有诗意，细碎灰白的叶子密密麻麻长
一脑袋，就是《奥列佛风景速写》里树的样子。还有各种
一律开紫色小碎花的草，迷迭香、百里香和鼠尾草，全都
《斯卡波罗集市》歌里唱的那些作料。
				<br><br><br>
中国人旗袍上绣梅兰竹菊，希腊裙袍上画小碎花和葡萄
藤。古今中外，自己土地上长什么，什么就是好看的，大
地才是全天下掌管美的神。
				<br><br><br>
雅典的高速公路最能开出寂寞又浪漫的感觉。车少，修路
不走捷径，顺着风景修。空旷的荒郊野外，明明可以走直
道，非要绕东绕西，修到好看的地方，会冷不丁辟出一块
空地来，铺上碎石子，留着给路过的车停下来欣赏。妙就
妙在，并没多少人得闲停那儿观景，但留还是要留的。
<br><br><br>
		
 希腊人半是慢悠悠的闲云野鹤，半是是急吼吼的惜时标
兵。超市买根葱都能跟收银员聊到地老天荒，一发动汽车
就半秒都等不得，势必要把泼洒掉的光阴抢回去。希腊人
自嘲说自己在十二月比德国人都勤劳，因为要把一年攒下
的工作一口气全做完。
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠没空欣赏沿途风景。她正紧紧盯着自己的手机导
航，确保自己没有走错车道。地图的指导令人迷惑，什么
叫做“保持在左侧车道，稍微右拐”?
				<br><br><br>
希腊的网络差强人意，语音常常滞后，开慢了又怕耽误后
面的司机抢时间。只能一边踩油门，一边死死盯住地图不
放。于是车子以一个微小的夹角逐渐跑偏，以毫厘之差，
积跬步而谬以千里。
				<br><br><br>
等到赵悠悠冷不丁拉回视线，瞄一眼路面，发现自己正骑
在车道分界线上。惶恐间下意识的猛打方向盘紧急纠错。
把后面的飞驰而至的越野车给吓惊叫连连。
				<br><br><br>
先是短促的喇叭声表达惊恐，跟着喇叭被重重的按下模拟
大声怒骂。如此司机仍不解恨，加速开到赵悠悠旁边，打
开车窗准备面对面斥责。不料肇事车子车窗被黑纱挡住，
乌漆嘛黑的啥也看不见，愤愤不平的受害者无奈最后长按
一次喇叭，声音婉转悠长，余音袅袅，这一声除了余怒，
还带着义正言辞的道德谴责。
				<br><br><br>
雅典常住人口不到四百万，人口数量、面积和GDP和北京 朝阳区大致相当。绝大部分市民聚居在市中心方圆四十平 方公里的地方，最高的建筑有二十五层楼，垃圾桶就放在 马路上，电缆挂在电线杆子上拖泥带水的穿街走巷。水泥 路路面崎岖不平，高傲的拒绝所有高跟鞋。马路牙子杂草 丛生，点缀着树上落下的松塔或者橘子。鸽子绕过橘子走 来走去，橘子是苦的，它们不爱吃。外卖不是披萨饼就是 皮塔饼，冰淇淋和点心齁甜，橱窗里的义乌小商品，看样 式是十年前的款。三条地铁线，太远的地方到不了。只能开车，开的不好就会一路被叭叭。
<br><br><br>
				说起为什么来这里?赵悠悠倒是有好几个版本，一开始她
会说什么希腊是西方文明的发源地，想要了解欧洲的文
化，体验不同的生活，以这里作为切入点，想来是极好的
云云。后来说烦了，就一句为了孩子读书，不卷还便宜。
这个答案通俗易懂，易于接受。其实还有一个更真实且简
单的答案:这里是他乡。
<br><br><br>

 够远、让来、能呆住，就行。八千公里，黄金签证，地中
海气候加食物。希腊三条都具备。通过物理距离上最大的
远离，实现最大程度的断舍离。至于为什么要这么做，一
开始只是从一个沙发开始的。
				<br><br><br>
车子开到阿提基·奥多斯收费站，黄色是自动缴费通道E- pass，蓝色通道上有个小人伸着一只手。赵悠悠埋头看地 图，一不小心扎进了自动收费车道，发现走错车道的时 候，后面的车排成了一长条。她腆着脸倒车，转到人工通 道，小心后退目不斜视，不用看也知道后面的司机必然一 个个铁青着脸，骂骂咧咧。希腊人不适合当司机，一开车 就火气大，平时他们也不这样。
蓝色通道的收费员热情的对着赵悠悠伸出的手臂打招呼， 他看不见她，因为被纱网挡住了。收费员拿走赵悠悠手里 的2.5欧元。闸杆刚一抬起，车子就一溜烟跑了，收费员举 着收据嘟囔:“έχει καεί(烧坏了。意思是:有毛 病)”
“什么?”后面的越野车司机递上零钱，随口搭腔。这是
一辆路虎揽胜。雅典是一座高低起伏不平的千年老城，道
阻且窄，路边还停满了车。如果不想徒增烦恼，车子越小
<br><br><br>

 越方便。倒也有不少真的勇士，敢于面对惨淡的人生，一
定要开大车，于狭窄中追求宽阔。
“神秘的人，不知道是黑帮还是恐怖分子?” 收费员对自 己的幽默甚为满意，笑着回答。
路虎司机看了一眼消失在前方的“黑帮车”，这黑色迷你 库柏不就是刚刚崴他那辆吗?中国有句老话:不是冤家不 聚头。希腊有句谚语叫做:Ο διάβολος έχει πολλά ποδά ρια。意思是魔鬼有很多腿。如果它打算烦你，就总能找到 你头上。
斯皮罗斯原以为这就算一别两宽了，没成想这不过才刚刚
开始。
				<br><br><br>
他刚下班，赶着去学校接孩子。中间还要抽十分钟去超市
买点吃的。烤肉?肉丸?还是芝士菠菜饼?芝士菠菜饼美
味又方便，是斯皮罗斯的挚爱。但孩子们的母亲明令禁止
他向孩子投喂超市成品食物。烤肉和肉丸前几天已经吃过
了。孩子们一致投票，以后再也不吃了。
<br><br><br>

 茱莉亚去西班牙之前和他达成的协议是:饮食健康，成绩
稳定。她知道自己必胜无疑。不管是之前在婚姻里，还是
离婚后的这几年，她什么时候输过呢?除了这一次，他无
论如何不同意孩子们跟她回西班牙，为此他把孩子们接到
身边，负隅顽抗快半年了。车子拐进超市停车场，斯皮罗
斯还是没想出来晚上到底要做点什么给孩子们吃。
				<br><br><br>
出了高速公路，赵悠悠再次陷入自己专属的公路难题:我
究竟在哪儿?
				<br><br><br>
四处的建筑都一模一样，七层高的住宅，米黄色的外墙，
所有的阳台又宽又大，全都挂着遮阳蓬。道路两边停满了
车子，每辆车都俯首帖耳:收紧后视镜，车轮贴在马路牙
子上。中间留出的道路依然不到两米。
				<br><br><br>
每往前开一步都有种有去无回的感觉。赵悠悠想起二十年
前在桂林爬穿山岩的经历。穿山岩是一个前后相通的扁扁
的岩洞，刚好能让一个人爬行穿过。从入口往前爬，岩洞
会越来越窄，最后出口窄到需要导游给拽出来。
				<br><br><br>
				此刻赵悠
悠感觉自己就像是挤在穿山岩里，随时会卡在某处，动弹
不得。一辆送外卖的蓝色电动车跟在后面，绝望的跟着赵
悠悠的车子蛄蛹。赵悠悠从后视镜里看到印度小哥坚韧不
<br><br><br>

 拔的亦步亦趋，也是爱莫能助，汽车雷达叫唤不已，听起
来不是“哎哟，左边擦边了”，就是“不行，右边要撞到
啦”，快不了一点。
				<br><br><br>
一个叼着香烟的大胡子脚步轻快的推开路边大门出来，看
到赵悠悠犹如慢速播放的行进，立刻停下脚步开始指挥。
希腊人很会教别人如何开车，左边右边，前进后退，给你
指点的明明白白。赵悠悠分娩式的驾驶有了助产士的帮
助，顺畅多了，很快就滑出产道，娩出成功，母子平安。
大胡子指挥完毕拂衣而去，不留功与名。
				<br><br><br>
地图导航耐心等赵悠悠开出来，好脾气的继续提示:“向 前行驶两百米，在停车标志处掉头” 赵悠悠一脚油门过 去，只转了半个车身子，车屁股还在隔离带这边，就被路 边停的车挡住了，她正准备回下方向，往后倒几米。不料 后头一辆路虎直怼过来，封住了退路。好噻，刚刚那么窄 的巷子都没难产，在大马路上给塞了个结实。赵悠悠按了 按喇叭，示意路虎后退一点。路虎打开车窗，送出一连串 恶龙咆哮。不明就里的赵悠悠解开安全带，带着十足的钝 感力走下车前去交涉。
<br><br><br>

 赵悠悠没有驾照。因为在希腊外国税号不让考驾照，不晓
得是什么逻辑。“我跟你说，希腊就没有逻辑”卖汽车保
险的小哥一边给她填单，一边说。“你就等着吧，这个规
定迟早会作废的”。
				<br><br><br>
道理也不难懂，这个规定造成了一大堆没有驾照的人每天
穿梭于大街小巷，人家也不是不想考驾照，是你不让人
考，这显然不得体。当投诉积累的越来越多，政府官员想
要解决这个问题的时候，根本不会去追溯当初为什么外国
税号不可以考驾照。于是大笔一挥，搬走了这个绊脚石，
至于搬走之后会不会留下个坑，谁也不知道。出了问题再
说，希腊人麻烦多，办法也多，而且他们不兴秋后算账，
办法不需要长期主义。
				<br><br><br>
没有驾照难免心虚，一坐驾驶位就犯冒名顶替综合症。每
当其他司机按着喇叭愤怒的经过她时，她心里就毫不犹豫
的认定，自己犯下了弥天大错，非得立刻改正不可。不过
下了车可就不一样了。赵悠悠女士其人坐在驾驶位是不合
法规的，但作为持有黄金签证的合法居留者，站在希腊大
地上可是合理合法，理直气壮的。
<br><br><br>

 “Can you speak English? I need a U-turn! ”(你会说 英语吗?我要掉头)她对路虎司机说。
斯皮罗斯把太阳镜推到额头，盯着眼前这个纤细的亚洲女
人和似曾相识的黑色迷你，耳边想起收费员的指控:“不
知道是黑帮还是恐怖分子”。这个女人长发披肩，跟希腊
本地人比起来，脸色略有些苍白，容貌清淡，仿佛擦把脸
就消失了。她穿宽松的衬衫和阔腿裤，风一吹扁扁的贴在
身上，就跟要飞走了似得。就她，还黑帮呢。
				<br><br><br>
“GPS says that I can turn around here"(GPS说我可 以在这里掉头)
斯皮罗斯车后等待左转的车越来越多，有几辆已经不耐烦
的在后面按起了喇叭。斯皮罗斯没说话，黑着脸挂挡倒
车。赵悠悠赶紧回到车上，忙不迭的掉头离去。
				<br><br><br>
当你离熟悉的环境足够远，每一件微不足道的小事，哪怕
只有针那么大，都能让你筋疲力尽。比如在陌生的道路上
诚惶诚恐，连调个头都免不了一番口舌与较量。
<br><br><br>

 说起来，还真有一个跟针有关的问题，也不知道雅典哪里
有卖针的地方，赵悠悠打算把房间的窗帘缝在一起，不然
老有个缝，挡不严。她最近有条金棕色灯芯绒的裤子破
了，没舍得扔，仍旧叠好放在衣柜最上面，防着哪天要用
到布头拉链什么的。小的时候，也是一件金棕色的灯芯绒
小背心，刚穿上没几天，就钻铁丝网勾出个洞。妈妈让赵
悠悠自己在书上选个图案，给她绣在洞上。赵悠悠不愿意
照书抄，自己画了个图案，妈妈一边绣一边问:这是什
么?赵悠悠说:是佛手瓜和它的须。在希腊总在为针头线
脑的事情犯难，越是小，越是无从着手，仿佛又回到了物
资匮乏的年代。
				<br><br><br>
一路向前，密集的车辆被回家的路吞噬，越来越稀疏，马 路也越来越细，最后拐进终极毛细马路利亚尼斯，就到家 了。这一片区叫格力卡尼拉，距离市中心14公里，算是比 较新的一个社区。不少房子修一半扔路边，也有被捡起来 重修的。每个地块面积大约在两三百平米之间，上面盖三 层楼，分住七八户人家。国内管这种叫花园洋房。不同的 是，每栋房子长的不一样，生活和管理方式也不同，比方 说有的烧油取暖，有的燃气，要不就干脆用壁炉烧柴，不 到十月阳台上就开始码起大堆大堆的粗木桩。
<br><br><br>

 赵悠悠这是第一次自己开车过来，围着楼兜了两圈才找到
空位停车。楼下有车库，但车库空间有限，进去出来都不
方便。大家都嫌麻烦，平时都停在路边。路灯幽暗，位置
窄小，赵悠悠小心翼翼靠边停下，努力使车子紧贴马路牙
子，她下车检查停车效果，对自己的停车技术颇为满意。
				<br><br><br>
前后两边的院子分属二楼的三户人家，推开院门可以看到
邻居院子中间放着石头喷泉洗手槽，草坪修剪的整整齐
齐，角落里长着一棵巨型马樱丹，粉加黄的花朵爬过院墙
挂到路边。赵悠悠的院子稀疏长着杂草，黄泥地裸露在
外，柠檬树和橘子树倒是枝繁叶茂，挂满绿色的果子。成
煜臣拉着行李箱哗啦哗啦走进来，一只猫从草丛里跳出，
快速经过他们逃出门外。
				<br><br><br>
“到家啦，这次算是长期安顿下来了” 赵悠悠说着接过儿 子手中的行李箱。
大门十几级台阶，几个箱子搬上去，属实是重体力劳动。
这几个月辗转在各种民宿中间，遇到没电梯的楼，搬不
动，只能就地拆箱，分而治之。就蹲在大楼大厅里拆，衣
服鞋子，茶具书本，挪出一半，让儿子守着，搬上去再拎
空箱子下来装剩下的。搬来搬去的，力气见长。
<br><br><br>

 推开门楼道里隐约闻到烘焙的焦香，一个物业告示牌贴在
门背后，贴着印有每个住户管理费的表格，再就是一张希
腊语的通知，大约又是检修电梯或是停电公告。经过大理
石楼梯，前面就是新家了。
				<br><br><br>
一进门儿子立刻倒在沙发上，口中虽然在说:“还有什么 要帮忙的吗?妈妈?” 但他一大早就跟着妈妈起床收拾， 打包，一直忙到天黑，从头到脚委实累得什么也不想做 了。赵悠悠拍拍儿子的脸:“你已经超额完成任务啦，好 好躺着休息吧”
“真的吗妈妈?我觉得我什么也没做呀”成煜臣从抱枕后
面露出眼睛，对妈妈说。
				<br><br><br>
“你看你这几天又是组装家具，又是修台灯和花洒，还要
打包，还要扔垃圾，还要上学，还要写作业，立下的赫赫
战功简直罄竹难书，你就安心躺着，我去给你煎牛排”
				<br><br><br>
“罄竹难书是说做的坏事很多，我亲爱的母亲”成煜臣嘴
上抱怨着，但心满意足的在沙发上摊平了身体。
<br><br><br>

 “你要不喜欢换成汗牛充栋也行。”赵悠悠摸摸儿子的脑
门，起身前把沙发前的台灯打开。客厅里洒满柔和昏黄的
灯光。房间陈设简单，配色清淡，除了墙角的壁炉稍微带
点希腊特色，其他跟赵悠悠八千里外的那个家并没有太大
区别。
				<br><br><br>
一日三餐，上学放学，千山万水之外的生活跟之前并没有
本质的不同。如果非要找不同，无非也就是日常不便:商
品匮乏，服务欠奉，很难找到合适的维修工和理发师。处
理这些琐碎困顿，会让人感觉狼狈且笨拙，适应希式英
语，接受新的处事规则，每天领教生活的鞭挞，仿佛回到
无知而充满敬畏的儿童时代。
				<br><br><br>
过去四十年积累的经验、成就与保护机制，在飞机起飞的
那一刹那，就已经被抛下。过往的社会身份不再存在，做
什么工作、有过什么成绩、占有多少财富、身边围绕过多
少优秀的人，统统作废。你只是你这个肉身。
				<br><br><br>
隔壁厨房，斯皮罗斯在用海绵擦用力擦洗烤盘上焦糊的鸡
肉汁，徒劳无功。干脆扔回烤箱草草了事。安娜和康斯坦
丁在跟妈妈视频，说学校里的长短，他们一般用西班牙语
<br><br><br>

 对话，当强调爸爸的不足的时候会切换到希腊语，好让斯
皮罗斯听得更清楚。安娜投诉了鸡肉的焦糊，康斯坦丁则
申请是否可以点肯德基弥补。茱莉亚不必亲自出马，孩子
回到母亲身边的重要性不言而喻。
				<br><br><br>
这伎俩斯皮罗斯屡见不鲜，他没打算有任何的回应，从他
答应离婚的那一刻起，他就下决心停止这些没有结果的拉
扯。他认为离婚是一个终结，但在茱莉亚看来它只是打开
了新的战场。她可真是一个不屈不挠的斗士。斯皮罗斯走
到阳台，试图屏蔽那些隐藏在日常问候里的攻击。
				<br><br><br>
晚风微凉，熟透的无花果散发出馥郁甜香。路灯下，他看
见一辆车停在了自己车库门口。由于车子体型庞大，他特
地把后院隔出来作为车库，如果只是临时停车，车主一会
儿就开走的话倒也不必计较。不过，这车看起来有几分眼
熟，斯皮罗斯走下阳台楼梯，来到院子，凑近一看，车窗
罩着黑网的黑色迷你库柏，这车在高速公路崴过他，在路
口转弯的时候堵过他，现在又阴魂不散的出现在这里!
				<br><br><br>
那个女人难道真是国外来的恐怖分子?她是在跟踪自己
吗?这个荒谬的念头很快就被他打消了。
<br><br><br>

 最近这些年，雅典各式各样的外国人越来越多是不争的事
实。难民、旅游者、数字游民、黄金签证持有者，他们跟
传统的度假人群不同，新移民构成复杂，性情生猛、懵懂
甚至可以说莽撞。
				<br><br><br>
早在十年前，街头还不曾有过流浪汉，但现在的雅典，你
常常可以看到无家可归者躺在路边的一堆肮脏的被褥里。
宪法广场附近一条街道完全被吸毒者占据，常年聚集着神
思恍惚的人群，旁若无人的当街注射海洛因。
				<br><br><br>
斯皮罗斯不是一个保守排外的人，但这种难以抵挡的力
量，正在蚕食着他熟悉的环境。作为热情奔放的地中海地
区，又是以旅游为经济支撑的城市，开放和乐于接受新鲜
事物的心态让雅典人普遍拥有包容、富于弹性、乐于助人
及好客的性格。斯皮罗斯也不例外，可他偶尔仍然会被移
民们的不守规矩给激怒。
				<br><br><br>
如果说难民的无礼可能是由于贫穷和没受过好的教育等客
观原因造成，还姑且能理解。那么这个能说一口流利英
文，穿戴体面，有车有房的亚洲女人，反复践踏既有规
则，咄咄逼人的入侵，除了对主人的蔑视和不尊重，还能
是什么原因?斯皮罗斯想起那个从车里出来带着某种优越
感，颐指气使的女人的脸，忍无可忍，最终拿起手机拨通
交警的电话。
<br><br><br>

<h3> 2.罪名:冒犯者</h3>
				<br><br><br>
一大早，闹钟还没响，赵悠悠就起来了。希腊跟中国有五
个小时的时差，来希腊好几个月了，还是比之前醒的要早
很多。这倒是好事，如果谁真的改不掉熬夜的习惯，可以
搬到有时差的地方试试。
				<br><br><br>
过了八月，雅典的太阳变得非常体贴，温度恒定，亮度优
秀，有太阳的地方都是暖的，被照到的东西都带着明快色
彩。阳光从早到晚一直金灿灿的，不像有些地方，中午烈
日白焰，早晚虚弱苍白。
				<br><br><br>
衣服琐碎都已经归置到该去的地方。半夜擦的玻璃窗，当
时没看清楚，干了以后留下大块大块水渍。雅典的水质非
常硬，洗完头发掉一地，男人一半是秃头。
				<br><br><br>
清早的车和狗听起来都显得更遥远。四下无人，正好坐在
阳台喝咖啡，看太阳小步挪到桌上。离婚之前，她一个人
度过无数个这样的清晨，独自坐在阳台看天光亮起，心里
充满对即将面对的一切的抗拒。即将醒来的丈夫和孩子，
即将套上的高跟鞋，即将走进的公司大门和几百张卡座里
的脸。其实身处其中也并不厌恶，可作为脑子里的概念，
<br><br><br>

 他们的存在让人感觉身不由己，犹如坐牢。他们推动着自
己不断前往下一个任务，不管甘不甘愿。
				<br><br><br>
她不知道年轻时一直提着的那口气去了哪里，此时自己就
像没了火车头的车厢，全靠原有的惯性与肩头的责任在前
行，勉为其难，踉踉跄跄，随波逐流。
				<br><br><br>
一切都始于那个沙发。
头层牛皮转角沙发，柔软宽大，坐进去连小腿都要打直，
威武雄壮的占据了客厅的一整面墙，是一件气派的单品。
家具店的销售说，你别看它贵，可以当传家宝，皮子越用
越漂亮的。丈夫成栋梁一眼相中，一定要买。那就买吧，
他对家庭建设一向没有任何想法，这少有的坚持有必要满
足。
				<br><br><br>
这沙发她当时也是喜欢的，既漂亮又好打理，客人来了也
少不得会打听哪里买的?什么皮?坐着很舒服云云。沙发
用鹅毛填充，坐上去就跟坐到云里去似得，哪里能久坐?
坐着坐着就歪了，歪着歪着就躺下了。一家三口，横一条
竖两条，在云里卧着。
<br><br><br>

 “这个沙发会吃人”赵悠悠对躺在贵妃椅上的成栋梁说。
“舒服的不想起来吧?也不看看谁挑的”成栋梁握着电视
遥控器换台。
				<br><br><br>
“躺的我颈椎疼”赵悠悠摸着后勃颈说。
				<br><br><br>
“拿个枕头垫垫”成栋梁把身边的抱枕抽出来，扔给她。
“我忽然觉得我爸妈那个实木的沙发不错，只能正襟危
坐，没有机会颈椎疼”。
				<br><br><br>
“你这是缺乏锻炼，你跟我去跑跑马拉松，什么毛病都好
了”成栋梁最近在跑马拉松，赵悠悠同事和一大帮老同学
也在跑，全中国人都在跑马拉松。
				<br><br><br>
“不去，谢谢”赵悠悠不讨厌跑步，但它太时髦了，时髦
的让人讨厌。成栋梁了解她，但凡大家都做点什么得时候
她就非得拧巴。他没说什么，回头看自己的球赛。
<br><br><br>

 这沙发何其讨厌，但又忍不住要坐，坐上去就要倒，倒下
来脖子又要疼。循环往复。
				<br><br><br>
闹钟响了，赵悠悠的咖啡也见了底。她回厨房准备早餐和
午餐。方便面用温泉蛋裹匀，浇上蒸鱼豉油和醋，再来点
芝麻油，撒上肉碎和海苔，就是歌志轩秘制拌面了。午餐
是番茄虾仁和黄油拌西蓝花，抓把紫菜打个蛋凑个芙蓉鲜
蔬汤。超市就只有那几种菜，来回排列组合，因陋就简。
十五分钟搞定。
				<br><br><br>
				治大国如烹小鲜，上百人的部门拿得下，
几个小菜，无非是公式化操作和细节的把控，多吃多分
析，再难的菜肴也经不住拆分研究，再不济还有美食博主
兜底。赵悠悠每次拿到项目也是如此，业务框架理出来，
相关业务方分头聊完，关键报告对照着看一遍，找到数据
点，再扒着数据一条一条拆，数据是根，一旦扎下根，就
很难被撼动。数据不会骗人，数据自有逻辑，数据会讲故
事。
				<br><br><br>
吃完收拾好，和儿子两人说笑着出门。晨光里，郊外的空
气好不新鲜。还没走到车跟前呢，就觉得好像有点不对
劲。
<br><br><br>

 车牌不见了!
				<br><br><br>
是在哪里挂掉了吗?赵悠悠心想，转到车头一看，车头挂
车牌的位置光秃秃，露着几个螺丝洞。生活在这里的每一
天，每一天!都会跟各式各样的惊喜(吓)不期而遇，相
比之下，这一次排得上惊吓榜前十。
				<br><br><br>
车牌是被人偷走了吗?偷去能有什么用呢?用来套牌吗?
还好车子看起来没事，只是车牌没有了，但没有车牌今天
还能开车吗?孩子要怎么去学校呢?
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠脑子里的念头跟非洲野牛狂奔一般滚滚而来。什么
沙发太软这种事情，是多么微不足道，自己为什么要无病
呻吟，不远万里跑到这里，无休止的面对这些莫名其妙的
琐碎小事?
				<br><br><br>
可恨的是，所有生活的毒打，全都是自找的，能怪谁呢?
恨加一等的是，如若成栋梁知道这个事情，肯定会不屑的
耻笑，有的人就是没苦硬吃。他就不明白赵悠悠为什么要
去荒山野岭徒步，几天几夜的在外露营。有好好的床不
睡，饭不吃，非要去遭罪。想锻炼可以健身，可以跑马拉
<br><br><br>

 松，再说了，徒步不也一样是个从众的事情吗?人活在世
界上，有什么事是只有你独一份的呢?
				<br><br><br>
这些都不算什么，最最可恨的是，她每天用尽心力去处理
的这些琐事，无非都是些普通的生活的细枝末节，能否应
对，毫无价值，没有意义。也许成栋梁说的对，她就是在
徒劳无功的没苦硬吃。
				<br><br><br>
成煜臣在雨刮上找到一张纸，扫了一眼，递给赵悠悠。一 张粉红色的表格，能认识的也就是代表日期的阿拉伯数字 和自己的车牌号。看样子多半是罚单，赵悠悠打开翻译软 件，扫描跳出来触目惊心的几个字:犯罪须知!她紧张的 往下看去，大概明白了是怎么回事。她昨晚把车停在不该 停的地方，侵犯了他人的权利，限期需缴纳罚款20欧， 10天后到警察局取车牌。犯罪通知单的底部大大的写着: 冒犯者。大概是罪名。
这时一位面容清矍的老太太无声无息的从拐角走过来，笑
容像蜗牛的触角般缓缓伸出，试图对接路边的这对母子。
赵悠悠绽开笑容，抓住救命稻草一般赶紧问这位慈祥的邻
居:
<br><br><br>

 ““Good morning! May I ask what happened with it?”(早上好，请问这是发生了什么?)赵悠悠等不及慢 慢寒暄，直接把手上的纸片递给老太太。
<br><br><br>
				“Καλημέρα(早上好)”老太太摇摇头，表示听不懂英 文。她眯起眼睛看了一眼纸片，又看了看赵悠悠的车，指 了指斯皮罗斯院门前的禁停标志，摇摇手说:
“Όχι, εδώ απαγορεύεται το παρκάρισμα.”(这里禁止停车)
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠这才看到旁边院门上挂了个白色铁牌子，中间是一 个褪色的红色大写的P，一条斜杠拦腰把P劈成两半，表示 不接受P。她昨晚压根没注意到这个。可违章就违章为什 么警察要收走自己的车牌呢?转念一想，也对，中国电子 眼布的跟天网似得，违章证据确凿，犯罪寸步难行，不需 要劳烦交警。可希腊连红绿灯都常常坏掉，更别提电子眼 了，线上管不了，只能线下实物管控。车牌扁扁两个，收 也方便，还也方便。还不耽误法规教育，没牌车不能开， 只能乖乖在家反省。希腊人最善于处理实际问题，办法往 往轻巧又实用。
<br><br><br>

 房子里的人听到动静走出阳台，一个身材高大的中年男
人，穿过院子来到门口。须发浓密，表情戏谑。
				<br><br><br>
“Κalimela, Malaka，hope you enjoy your ticket.” (早上好，混球，希望你喜欢你的罚单)他手撑着自己的 院门，对赵悠悠说。他魁梧的身躯在地面投下巨大的阴 影，完完全全的挡住了赵悠悠头顶的阳光，在她身后投下 巨大的阴影。赵悠悠认出来，这不就是昨天堵在她车子后 头的那个路虎司机吗?
<br><br><br>
				赵悠悠这下清楚了事情的来龙去脉，自己昨晚停车挡住了
他的车库门，他报警把自己的车牌收走了。有一说一，确
实是自己是错在前头。但他不但行为上报复，态度上还一
副“我故意的”样子，无疑是当面宣战。
				<br><br><br>
“What? Did you call the police to take off my plate?”(什么?是你叫警察拿走了我的车牌吗?)赵悠 悠问道，要确认自己的推断。
<br><br><br>
				“Welcome to Greece, Princess. You can't just do whatever you want here. People follow the rules,” (欢迎来到希腊，公主。在这里你不可以为所欲为。人是
<br><br><br>

 要守规矩的)斯皮罗斯拿腔作势的回答，带着报复成功的
喜悦。
				<br><br><br>
“Rules? In Greece?” (规矩?你说希腊有规矩?)赵 悠悠被气得忍不住冷笑。天晓得，希腊人有多么不喜欢遵 守规则。时间不多了，她没打算继续争论，他既然住在这 里，那就来日方长，她打开车门示意儿子上车。
<br><br><br>
				“Bravo! But you can’t drive without plates.”(勇 气可嘉，但你不能无牌开车!)斯皮罗斯看着她发动了车 子，不依不饶的扒着门喊道。
<br><br><br>
				“Try to stop me!” (你挡我试试)赵悠悠边吼边发动 车子，驶出街道。她在心里默默咒骂着这个自以为是的希 腊男人，也许是身在异国他乡，她遇事都尽量保持忍让， 但此时此刻，她的怒火直冲脑门。希腊人做事这么不给人 留余地吗?中国人是崇尚温良恭让，但前提是你不要真的 惹到她，你对天蝎座中国女人的愤怒的力量一无所知，你 就给我等着瞧吧!
<br><br><br>

 “Try not killing people today!” (今儿尽量别在马路 上杀人)斯皮罗斯冲着远去的车子喊。
生命是一席华美的袍，上面爬满了虱子。何止华美的袍上
有，粗布衫上虱子更多啊。赵悠悠把车停在坑坑洼洼的学
校后门。跟着成煜臣走进学校，今天要去家委会帮忙布置
万圣节场地。
			
作为新来的中国妈妈，这是一个了解学校，认识其他家长
的大好机会。
				<br><br><br>
母亲常说，孩子就是妈妈的风筝线，有成煜臣跟着，她就
不担心赵悠悠真的飞了。有孩子的母亲不会离经叛道，不
会行差踏错，英惠可以变成一棵树，可以说:为什么不可
以死?仁惠有六岁的智宇，是不可以死的。英惠的惨烈尚
可撕心裂肺的嚎叫，仁惠只能在自己的身份里静悄悄腐
坏，变成儿子养料。家委会的家长，不论来自哪个国家，
几乎都是女性。学校的教育精神是要学生成为有社会责任
感的人。从来没有人觉得这个说法可笑，绝大部分的男性
家长，连普通的家庭责任都没法好好承担，所谓的社会责
任感要从何谈起?在成为有社会责任感的人之前，为什么
不先培养孩子成为有家庭责任感的父亲(母亲)?
<br><br><br>

 “Yoyo, come here!” (悠悠，来这里)家委会主席简 站在仓库门口招呼她。万圣节晚会的糖果和装饰物都已经 买好了。每年整个欧洲从从中国进口大量的塑料和纸制 品，用于节日装饰。这些五颜六色的廉价的商品像是色彩 斑斓的糖纸，把圣诞节、复活节、狂欢节、感恩节和万圣 节一个一个的包起来，使其活泼热闹充满童趣。
几个中国妈妈正把发光南瓜搬到校门口的展台上，有爱玩
的妈妈打开电池，电动蜘蛛在墓碑上闪起红光。中国妈妈
一直是这所国际学校活动志愿者的中坚力量，虽然大多妈
妈英语都不太行，但每次学校举办活动，她们总是全力以
赴。
				<br><br><br>
“How are you, my dear?” (你好吗，亲爱的)简热 情地拥抱了赵悠悠。
<br><br><br>
				“Keep practicing not to kill people” (一直在练习 不要杀人)赵悠悠比了个驾驶的手势，调侃道。简知道她 刚买车不久，还在学习希腊的道路规则。
<br><br><br>

 “Better?” (有效果吗)简笑着问。
				<br><br><br>
“No, I need my killing talent today.” (不，今天我 需要我的杀人天赋)赵悠悠一语双关开着玩笑，万圣节 嘛。再说今天也确实很想杀人。
<br><br><br>
				她跟着简走进仓库，桌上放着几把泡沫做的大弯刀。她拿
起弯刀，墙角有个塑料骷髅架子，赵悠悠把它想象成那个
报警收她车牌的可恶的邻居，一刀砍过去，可恶邻居中刀
倒地，我砍，我再砍，他翻着白眼，舌头伸的老长。她忍
不住笑起来，做了个利索的姿势收起刀，跟着问简:
				<br><br><br>
“How are you, Jane? Got all the help you needed?”(你怎么样，简，人手够吗?)

				<br><br><br>
				简笑了起来。她很喜欢这些中国妈妈的帮助，她们勤劳能
干，善于配合，还异常的慷慨。而她自己也总是尽力帮助
这些家庭融入学校生活。不过，尽管双方都友好热情，不
同的文化和语言依然不时在彼此间筑起了理解的高墙。
<br><br><br>

 “干活吧，”她心里想着。
				<br><br><br>
“在共同劳动中，大家总是目标一致，和谐又愉快的!”
简需要通过家委会的活动来筹款，去组建跨国交流社团。
她的儿子十一年级，她希望这个社团能够帮她儿子增加社
会活动实践履历。一个高效又不生幺蛾子的团队太重要
了。
				<br><br><br>
劳动是成年人的游戏。人们在劳动中统一认识，在劳动中
相互协作，在劳动中彼此了解，在劳动中获得成就感和个
人认同。妈妈们大多也知道简的目的，但也乐在其中，这
是一个机会，来这里的每一个人，都割下了过去的千丝万
缕，需要重新搭建新的生活框架、社交脉络。这个机会让
她们能够彼此观察，相互识别，寻找同类。茫茫四百万人
里，总得认识点什么人，在为难的时候，能有个浅淡的照
应。
				<br><br><br>
对赵悠悠来说如果不是为了儿子，这个浅淡的照应都不必
有。他是自己的线，自己的凡间，有他就飞不了，但就算
飞不了，也要在半天里悬着，不下来。就算悬在那里不过
是处理些毫无价值、没有意义的生活的细枝末节，也要悬
着，不下来。
				<br><br><br>
“我觉得国外的节日特别有意思，外国人很有娱乐精神。
我们的节日就知道吃。饺子粽子月饼，换个节日换种吃
的。悠悠，你说对不对?”朱红娜边说边把两个布满红血
丝的“眼珠子”巧克力放到眼前装鬼。
				<br><br><br>
“那是因为我们国家的根是农耕文明，农民天生务实，好
好吃是对天地供养的尊重。”赵悠悠拿起手机帮她拍下这
个有趣的鬼脸。
				<br><br><br>
“那你说什么样的人会发明这些节日和玩法?”朱红娜问
道。
				<br><br><br>
“始于宗教，兴于商人。归根结底，无中生有、空手套白
郎画饼的人”赵悠悠回答。
				<br><br><br>
“你讲话很有意思”坐在右手边的丁芹冲赵悠悠笑了笑说
道。她正在把晚上要售卖的糖果往袋子里装。
<br><br><br>

 “希腊是东正教，照理也不过万圣节，我们在这里弄得热
火朝天的，不就是为了筹款吗?”赵悠悠在分糖果，她在
生产线上是丁芹的上游。
				<br><br><br>
“我们过万圣节是因为我们是美国学校”远处在裁彩纸的
崔茜也加入了讨论。
				<br><br><br>
“最原始的万圣节，找些柴火点堆火驱驱鬼就完事儿了。
可能有商人在某次驱鬼的时候就着手头的商品编了个故
事，教小朋友们戴着面具去敲门要糖，大过节的，家长也
都愿意小朋友高兴”赵悠悠说道。
				<br><br><br>
“别管它有没有商业因素，首先它让孩子们开心，这是最
重要的。我希望我的孩子能一直保持童真。这也是我们下
定决心搬到希腊的原因。国内的教育太卷了，孩子都不能
玩，我们呢，玩好是第一位的，什么补习班都不上的，一
有时间就用来旅游。前几天才从法国回来”崔茜对节日活
动很认真，她一说话大家就都沉默了。
				<br><br><br>

 “我们也不上补习班”。过了一会儿，朱红娜见没人搭 腔，怕崔茜尴尬，补了一句。赵悠悠分完糖，拿上包匆匆 出门赶往JUMBO给儿子买万圣节的道具和服装。
JUMBO是希腊最大的小商品超市，走进JUMBO就好比走 进了义乌。一排排面具、帽子、袍子、死神拿着镰刀、火 盆吐着烈焰，邦妮兔子、凯蒂猫，小鬼卡斯帕和吸血鬼德 古拉，应有尽有，全都来自中国。顾客穿梭如云，试穿各 种戏服，还不时打开道具的音效，阴森恐怖的笑声此起彼 伏。在经过一个被汽车模型夹住的手臂的时候，赵悠悠想 起自己车子惨遭摘牌的遭遇，突然有了个主意。
<br><br><br>

<h3> 3.万圣节的交手 </h3>
夜幕降临，成煜臣穿上粉红色套头衫，戴上鱿鱼游戏的面 具，跟好朋友一起去参加学校的活动，成煜臣面具画的是 三角形，陆鸣是方形，分别对应鱿鱼游戏里的不同角色。 唯一的女孩王萱炀穿黄色T恤外套橙色背带裙打扮成剧中 的偶人娃娃。几个人互相帮着调整服饰，叽叽喳喳出门， 成煜臣边走边叮嘱妈妈准备好糖果，晚点要跟其他朋友一 起来Trick-or-Treat。
孩子们走后，赵悠悠掏出手机开始搜日本恐怖片《午夜凶 铃》里贞子的照片，《午夜凶铃》是她看过的最吓人的恐 怖片。贞子被人扔到井里慢慢死去，最后变成充满怨气的 女鬼，瞳孔掉到下眼睑，长发遮住大部分脸庞。当有人播 放关于她故事的录像带的时候，她会从电视里肢体扭曲的 爬出来。赵悠悠选了一张面目尤其狰狞的绿脸下载到相 册，用A4纸打印出来，跟着拿白乳胶把贞子的大照贴到在 JUMBO买的塑料面具上，面具后粘上时亮时灭的绿色 LED灯，跟着带上在JUMBO一起买的假发、白袍和半截 手臂溜到了院子里。
<br><br><br>

 赵悠悠的后院跟斯皮罗斯的车库连在一起，中间隔着一个
水泥花槽，里面种着几棵灌木作为隔断。斯皮罗斯一般是
倒着开进来，驾驶位靠着水泥槽。赵悠悠准备把贞子安排
在灌木丛里，这样一来就只有司机一个人有机会欣赏到这
个试图从灌木里挣扎爬出的女鬼。
				<br><br><br>
天蝎座果然是以复仇为快乐的星座。赵悠悠兴致勃勃的把
假手臂用别针固定在袍子上，使其一前一后的在地上呈现
爬行的姿势，又把她院子里做装饰用的希腊风格的土陶罐
塞到袍子里当做贞子的身子，面具用皮筋绑在一个矿泉水
瓶子上杵在水泥槽边缘，最后戴上又黑又长的假发。一打
开灯，连赵悠悠自己都给下了一跳，跟什么电锯惊魂相
比，还是东方式的恐怖最渗人。
				<br><br><br>
布置完毕，她开了一瓶来自圣托里尼的阿斯提克干白在阳 台上坐下来，打开JBL迷你小音箱播放起肖斯塔科维奇， 坐等自己还击的第一枪打响。
希腊得天独厚的地理位置，让随便一款酒都清亮又浓郁，
即便是超市买的平价酒都相当好喝。半杯酒下肚，赵悠悠
又有了灵感，她跑下院子，把音箱塞进土陶罐肚子里。
<br><br><br>

 刚跑回阳台，斯皮罗斯的车就已经开到门口。电动院门缓 缓打开，车子慢慢倒进来，熄火...半天没有动静。赵悠悠 神经紧绷，她甚至没忍住点了一下手机播放键，还好及时 按停没来得及发出声音。车里还是没有动静，孩子们可能 去爷爷奶奶家过周末，也可能跟朋友去Trick-or-Treat要 糖去了。可恶邻居说不定是在打电话，也可能...只是正常 的中年人熄火以后不愿面对现实的短暂逃避。
足足有十分钟之久，赵悠悠都快放弃了，这时车门开了， 邻居高大的身影从车上下来。她忙不迭的按下手机播放 键....空洞遥远的音乐声...风吹树林的沙沙声...诡异的挣扎 声...什么东西掉到深坑的失重声...女人凄厉的叫声，从地面 那个披头散发的，忽闪忽闪的绿色鬼脸的白色大肚子里传 出...
邻居发现地上趴着的白衣绿脸女鬼的时候，瞬间窜起半米
多高，并以一种极其罕见的姿势在空中舞动了一下，继而
回到大地，跟着猛地敲击车子引擎盖，并发出一声大吼。
吼声活像什么野狼在嚎，像是马上就要丧失人性变为狼
人。出于对自身安全的考虑，赵悠悠迅速停止拍摄跑回房
间。少时，狼人恢复了理智，凑近看了一眼这个装置，他
踢了一脚贞子，把她的头揪起来扔到赵悠悠院子里。迈着
愤怒的咚咚作响的步子回家了。
				<br><br><br>
娱乐精神确实是个好东西。就算被吓成狗也不能真的发脾 气，否则就是“没有幽默感”。赵悠悠心满意足的把杯子 里的葡萄酒喝完，哼哼着“日落西山红霞飞，战士打靶把 营归” 收拾好院子里的东西，收兵回营。明天还得去警察 局讨还车牌，这事儿还没完。
进屋刚把贞子的脸揉成一团扔到垃圾桶，她的社交平台就
跳出了一条消息。打开一看，是一个她刚到雅典的时候添
加的好友，雅典职业轮椅篮球队员斯蒂夫。
				<br><br><br>
“厉害啊，姐们儿，是不是胡乱停车被摘牌了?”斯蒂夫
幸灾乐祸的问，他看到了赵悠悠发的问询如何拿回车牌的
帖子。
				<br><br><br>
斯蒂夫是一个年轻又帅气的小伙儿，长得有几分酷似年轻
时候的查理辛。二十岁车开太快失去了一条腿，继而开始
打轮椅篮球，一路打进职业联赛。斯蒂夫一直在问赵悠悠
要不要一起去喝酒，还说服她说跟他出去喝酒的好处是:
<br><br><br>

 就算没有预约也有座位。“你有座位可我没有啊”赵悠悠 说。“你可以坐我身上，我不介意，你又没多重”斯蒂夫 对自己的特殊非常满意，车祸改变了他的人生，而且是从 好的方面。斯蒂夫车祸前在餐厅做服务员，是芸芸众生里 的一个普通青年。失去右腿后，他开始打篮球，拍广告， 成为励志风云人物，每天各种活动不断，继续无所畏惧的 开跑车，在雅典夜晚的街道上飚到180。或许他原本就不 是一个普通青年，只是车祸让他找到了出口。不管他如何 活跃，赵悠悠总感觉他还是寂寞，话特多。她倒是愿意多 陪他说说话，但对着一个年纪只有自己一半的人，不知道 说什么。她对他吵闹的希腊音乐实在共鸣不起来，他说古 典音乐自己一听就想睡觉。
“我不是故意停的，谁知道那里不能停啊?你快教教我怎
么处理这个罚单”赵悠悠回复斯蒂夫的揶揄。
				<br><br><br>
“我跟你说，你不能跟希腊人凶，你要哀求他们。你明天
去跟警察哭诉:我是个外国人，每天要接送孩子，您看，
能不能行个方便让我尽早拿回车牌?他们马上就心软了”
斯蒂夫给赵悠悠出主意。
				<br><br><br>
“这还能尽早吗?我看罚单上写的是10天”赵悠悠问道。
<br><br><br>

 “不然去找警察干嘛?或者，你推我去警察局，我跟他们
说你每天要送我去医院。”
				<br><br><br>
“真的假的?你明天有空?”
				<br><br><br>
“哎呀，明天不行，我有比赛”
				<br><br><br>
“得啦，心意心领了，我明天去瞧瞧到底啥情况”
				<br><br><br>
“我说真的，后天我可以”
				<br><br><br>
后天有后天的借口，希腊人每天嘴上付出不知道多少热心
关怀和帮助，出主意是一把好手，落到实际行动就犯大
难，人要走亲戚、要健身、要打球、要喝咖啡、要参加朋
友的生日会，总之分身乏术。再说等到后天离拿牌也没几
天了。
<br><br><br>

 希腊人帮忙出主意有一个问题，他们给的都是高阶主意。
关注点放在:如何搞定警察，改变规则，缩短惩罚期，尽
快拿到车牌。但他们不知道，对于赵悠悠这个外国人来
说，最基础的问题是:这么多警察局，究竟去哪个?
开具罚单的警察局隶属马鲁西，位于奥林匹克中心旁。赵
悠悠去的时候蓝色铁门大开着，没有门卫，她径直走进办
公楼，十个办公室有九个没人的。走廊空荡荡，有办公人
员在办公室抬头看见她，没质疑问询，而是转过头继续打
自己的电话。最终走到一个有柜台的办公室门口，看到一
个穿制服的警员，她赶紧逮着问:
				<br><br><br>
“早上好，我的车牌被摘了，我来缴费，请问这里是收银
柜台吗?”
				<br><br><br>
帅气的警员一脸平静，一只手转动着另外一只手上的婚
戒，似乎在处理她说的话，过了有十秒钟，他向旁边的一
位大姐模样的警员叽里呱啦说了一通，大姐认真给他解释
了一番，跟着警员转过头来对着赵悠悠，问道:
				<br><br><br>
“你的车子在哪里上的牌?”
<br><br><br>

 “我不知道，我是在市中心买的车子” 赵悠悠努力回忆， 车行经理有没有跟她说起过究竟在哪里上的牌。毫无印象。
<br><br><br>
				身材魁梧的科斯塔斯除了缴费信息说的贼清楚，其他信息 都解释的非常模糊:“科斯塔斯英语不好...科斯塔斯老 了，记心不好...亲爱的，我住院了，我心脏有毛病...”提车 心切的赵悠悠遇到这种情况也只能安慰他:“你说的我都 能听懂...你不老，看起来精神很好...你身体好点了吗?我的 押金能退我了吗?”一说到退钱，科斯塔斯马上音讯全 无，石沉大海，上帝保佑科斯塔斯。
帅气警员跟大姐警员又一通叽里呱啦，大姐认真解释，警
员听懂后转过头来对着赵悠悠，一字一句的说:
				<br><br><br>
“首先，你要去银行、或者邮局缴罚款;其次，你拿到收
款单以后，去市中心的警察总局，你的车牌会被移交到那
边，你需要跟他们预约打申请，然后等他们通知你再去拿
车牌”
<br><br><br>

 原来不是在这里交罚款!斯蒂夫根本不认为赵悠悠不懂的
是基本流程，半个字都没跟她提起过要如何交罚款，而她
想当然的来到警察局，指望着一次能办完这个事情。这里
是希腊，怎么可能一次办完一件事情?得，好歹打听到一
点信息，也不算完全白跑一趟，接下来找一家银行去缴费
吧。
				<br><br><br>
刚走门去，帅气警员叫住她:“等一等” 。赵悠悠转身回 到办公室。
“你这个罚单日期写错了，肇事日期是3号，开单日期是2 号，你可以去跟受理的警察申诉，让他们早点还你车牌”
好嘞，又是高阶支招，不如你告诉告诉我到银行找哪个柜 台缴费，这个更有用一些。饶是如此，赵悠悠还是怀着感 恩的心告别再次离去。奥林匹克广场空无一人，阳光在广 场中央巨大的白色廊架下投射出整齐的条纹，大风从广场 上跑过来跑过去，赵悠悠一路走，一路默诵接下来的流 程，银行...缴费...警察局...预约...打申请...等通知...拿车牌...
<br><br><br>

 银行的大门是双层的，你只能在其中一扇门关闭的时候才
能开启另外一扇门。壁垒森严让人感觉里面是不是正在发
生抢劫。真正进了门反倒很随意，甚至都没人过来招呼一
声。完全去中心化的大厅，客户经理随机分布在没有任何
指示牌的办公桌前，并没有客户柜台这种东西，一时间让
人不知道要找谁问好。这时一个中年女工作人员抬起头
来，没来得及躲避，被赵悠悠抓住了视线。
				<br><br><br>
“下午好，请问交通罚单是在哪里办理?”赵悠悠问道
				<br><br><br>
女工作人员一脸茫然，赵悠悠只好又重复了一遍问题。
				<br><br><br>
“很抱歉，我不明白你说的这个业务，我们这里不处理这
个”
				<br><br><br>
“请问你知道哪个银行受理缴费吗?”赵悠悠不死心的追
问。
				<br><br><br>
“很抱歉，我不知道”
<br><br><br>

 马上就下午三点了，从警察局出来银行已经下班，好不容
易等到两点上班，什么也没问出来。好在还能去邮局缴
费，可这个点赶过去，邮局必然也关门了。太棒了，一天
到晚，东奔西跑，徒劳无功，一事无成。
				<br><br><br>
“妈妈，我们什么时候能有车用?”成煜臣站在厨房看赵
悠悠做饭。
				<br><br><br>
“我不知道，宝贝。我们刚来的时候不是也没有车吗?”
赵悠悠拿出解冻好的牛肉放到砧板上。
				<br><br><br>
“刚来的时候我们住在地铁边，现在这个地方离地铁太远
了”成煜臣略有些抱怨的说。
				<br><br><br>
本来以为有车可以扩大行动半径的，结果一搬到这个天远
地远的地方，车就给封印住了。赵悠悠拿出磨刀棒，一下
一下的抛光切肉刀。
<br><br><br>

 又是一大早，带上罚单去找邮局。邮局门脸不突出，来回
在同一个街区转了好几圈，才找到地方。这是一个有点类
似国内快递站点的地方，长长的柜台后面站着一个长头发
脸色苍白的工作人员，正在跟一个街坊聊天。赵悠悠站在
一边等他们说完话。三四分钟过去，讨论都没有停止，中
途街坊递给工作人员一个文件，双方继续新的一轮交流。
幸亏一开始没有打断他们，原来不是街坊在聊天，而是真
正来办事的人。从头到尾赵悠悠也没搞清楚这俩人究竟是
在办理什么业务。最终长头发工作人员看她等的辛苦，停
下来问她是要办理什么业务。她解释了一下来意，长头发
回答说:
				<br><br><br>
“缴费的话不在这里，是要去邮局”
				<br><br><br>
“这里不就是邮局吗?“赵悠悠特地看了门脸上写的 ELTA(邮局)才进来的。
				<br><br><br>
“这里是邮政快递(ELTA Courier)，你要去邮局 (ELTA Post Office)才能缴费”长头发耐心的解释 说。
<br><br><br>

 只有真正在国外一而再再而三的被这样的小事难倒的人才
会知道，这一瞬间感觉有多憋屈。那是一种类似于小时候
好不容易得了一个冰淇淋，却一不小心给掉到了地上的感
觉。委屈、烦躁、痛恨自己的愚蠢和无能为力交织在一起
的复杂感受。旁边的“街坊”对赵悠悠说:
				<br><br><br>
				“来，把你的
手机地图给我”
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠把键盘调成希腊语输入模式，老实巴交的递上手 机，“街坊”在她手机上戳了一个地址，对她说:“这个 地方是最近的邮局，不过据我所知他们10点半就停止处理 业务了，你要快一点”。
道谢出门，三步并作两步，奔向目的地。
		<br><br><br>		
				很多日常小事，
它没有任何的逻辑难度，有的只是习惯、经验、理解方式
的偏差。当你处理完之后，发现这个事情极其简单。就好
像一个迷宫，你走出来之后，身后的轨迹连成一条线，会
觉得这是一条再明显不过的路径。可是你第一次身处其
中，会感到茫然、困惑，不停的四处碰壁。
				<br><br><br>
这大概就是小孩子跌跌撞撞长大的过程吧，它真的需要很
大的勇气和乐观的精神。很可惜，成年人都忘了自己是怎
么长大的了。赵悠悠赶在最后十分钟赶到邮局，拿号排队，解释情况，缴费，回执GET√，一气呵成。接下来就 可以向警察局在线预约拿车牌了。赵悠悠在路边完成预约 之后，她第一次对这件事情有了一点点的成就感。耗时两 天，南来北往跑了几十公里，终于缴费成功!算上预约成 功，拿车牌项目进度条向前推进45%。
<br><br><br>
				虽然依旧没有拿到车牌，但赵悠悠还是愉快的回到家里。
一步一个脚印，一个环节一个环节的攻克嘛。她没有细想
想自己花费了那么多时间，完成的任务有多么微小。两个
工作日，按照她之前的工作收入，差不多是两万人民币。
亲朋好友都很难理解她的行为，连她也很难解释为什么自
己要放下一切来到这里，去应对这些毫无价值的困难。她
心满意足的掏出钥匙准备开门，一个快递员拿着一个大包
裹走了过来。
				<br><br><br>
“请问二楼有一位叫斯皮罗斯·潘帕德里欧的人吗?” 快 递员扫描了一眼门禁上面的名字，二楼三户人，有一户没 有住人，是空白的。另外两个名字分别是悠悠赵和茱莉亚 ·加西亚。赵悠悠第一次知道可恶邻居名叫斯皮罗斯。
“我从来没有听说过这栋楼里有谁叫斯皮罗斯”赵悠悠倒
是没有撒谎，但也没安好心。
<br><br><br>

 “是吗?地址上写的是利亚尼斯街18号，二楼，不对吗? "快递员对着地址再次确认。
<br><br><br>“一定是搞错了，我就住在二楼，我不叫斯皮罗斯，我旁
边的住户很早就搬走了，会不会是那个人的快递?”赵悠
悠面不改色的说，她说的每一句话都是事实，但每一句都
在有意的混淆判断。实际上不需要，快递小哥压根不打算
仔细深究，只用写一个上门派送不成功，这个单就会传递
到下一个快递员手里。
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠不知道希腊快递员使用的是什么考核系统。她之前
买的电视机一直等了四十天都没到，最后是她跑到快递总
部追回来的。当电视送到家打开一看，液晶屏已经碎掉
了，估计是因为有破损，所以没人愿意负责，就一直扔在
仓库。之前赵悠悠打了无数个电话，在平台的社交媒体上
反复留言追问，都一直没有下落。最终跑到远在南部郊区
的快递总部，全程录像取证，反复确认，这种压迫式的维
权把总部的五个希腊人给吓了一大跳。第二天一早，电视
到了，然而是碎的。如此这般又一个完整来回，这才退货
成功，耗时两月终于看上了电视。那时候她为自己的胜利
而兴高采烈，完全不知道接下来的生活，每天都会重复类
<br><br><br>

 似的打怪活动，且打的全是史莱姆，低级杂兵，升级无
望。
看着快递小哥抱着可恶邻居的包裹离去，赵悠悠觉得这几
天奔波的辛苦稍微减轻了一些。
<br><br><br>

 <h3>4.年轻的巴赫</h3>
				<br><br><br>
阿提卡地区警察总局位于亚历山大大街173号。它是雅典 少有的高层大型建筑，竟然有足足13层之高呢!方方正正 的大楼，整整齐齐的小格子玻璃窗，正面看像是超大块的 华夫饼。走进用钢条加固的防爆玻璃大门，先过闸安检， 上交雨伞等危险物品，再登记个人信息，上交护照，领取 来访挂牌。这才能够上楼办事。
水磨石的旋转楼梯走到四楼电梯间就是交通违章处理办公
室，形形色色的违章人群一脸凝重的在排队等叫号。受斯
蒂夫的蛊惑，赵悠悠也打算尝试哭诉表演，看能不能争取
早日领到车牌。
	<br><br><br>			
				她穿了一身米黄色的羊毛西服，角色构想
是，板正的西服传达出良好的职业背景，柔和的颜色强化
自己温婉的性格，二者结合给警官一个“良民，求放过”
的好印象。思路没毛病，可她这个样子在一大堆穿着夹克
和机车服的摩托车违章的人群中完全是个显眼包。还好，
我们可以用微笑化解尴尬，赵悠悠内心努力强化自己的信
念感。听到叫号老老实实的来到警官面前:
“早上好，警官先生”
49

 “坐坐，什么事情啊?”警官笑眯眯的，一脸和善。
“我的车牌给收走了”
				<br><br><br>
“违章停车是吧?”警察从桌角一摞表格里抽了一张出
来。
				<br><br><br>
“是的，这是我的缴费回执”赵悠悠递上手里拿的回执和
罚单。
				<br><br><br>
警官看了一眼回执，拿起罚单开始照单填写表格，赵悠悠
还在想，究竟什么时候哭诉比较得体的时候，警官把表格
往她面前一递，说:“签字”
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠老老实实签字，小声嘟囔说:“那我什么时候能拿
车牌啊?”
<br><br><br>
 “罚单上不是写的十天以后吗?”警官笑着说。
				<br><br><br>
赵悠悠正准备开始背诵准备好的台词:“我是一个外国 人...我每天都要接送孩子上学，家里住的很远，我真的不 是故意违章停车的...” 警官就跟着说:
<br><br><br>
				“你后天过来拿吧”
				<br><br><br>
“啊?今天不可以吗?” 虽然有点得寸进尺，但如果今天 可以拿，那明天不是就不用跑一趟了吗?
<br><br><br>
				“车牌不在这里，要从马鲁西调过来。”警官言简意赅的
解释，他挥舞了一下申请表格，说:“我已经帮了你很大
的忙了”赵悠悠环顾四周，确实周围的机车服们都在埋头
自己填表格。即便后天来拿，也比预期时间提前了好几
天。怀着对警官的诚挚谢意，她愉快的离去，下楼领取自
己的护照和雨伞，这个时候，连收证件的工作人员头顶犹
如补丁一样的假发片也显得可爱起来了呢。
<br><br><br>

 车子拿回来的正是时候，刚好赶上去雅典古剧场听马友友
音乐会。
				<br><br><br>
希罗德·阿提库斯剧场是希腊著名的古代露天剧场，依山
而建，巨大的半圆形观众席由层层石阶构成，历经两千年
风霜，剧场的墙体和石柱很多已经破损，但使用无妨。
当观众们陆续走进剧场时，夜幕已经降临，残缺的大理石
石柱与拱门被射灯照亮，背景是深蓝夜空和玉色圆月。这
景象，让赵悠悠想起圆明园。历史更迭留下这些残垣断
壁，旧文明被粗暴扯断和碾压，新潮流覆盖住往日创伤，
只有这些倒在自己基座边的大石，沉默又固执的努力保持
着原有的形状。
				<br><br><br>
来的路上成煜臣发现路边一栋建筑上贴着甲骨文公司的 LOGO。“哇，雅典竟然也有甲骨文。”他兴奋的大叫。
成煜臣出生的那年，苹果手机正式进入中国。随之而来的
是智能应用科技爆炸，它让这一代孩子对高科技有天然的
热爱。还不会走路就已经能够熟练的操控触摸屏，还不会
说话就能够跟电子产品轻松的互动。
			<br><br><br>	
				赵悠悠不知道在从小
就被科技公司玻璃幕墙的高楼大厦包围的他们的眼里，雅
典是一个什么样的存在。这里没有高楼大厦，也看不见有
玻璃幕墙的建筑。随处可见无人管理的荒地和爆粗的涂
鸦。雅典的马路走着走着地板会变成玻璃的，玻璃下展示
的是某个时期的历史遗迹，它被考古学家细细剖开，保留
在被发现的地方，并郑重其事的用玻璃封存起来，镶嵌在
现代人修建的房子下，如同一颗琥珀。
				<br><br><br>
“雅典毕竟是一国之都啊，宝贝。有科技公司不奇怪”赵
悠悠说道。
				<br><br><br>
今天，在这一国之都的石头剧场，著名大提琴演奏家马友
友将在这里演奏巴赫、贝多芬、埃尔加、德沃夏克、勃拉
姆斯和谭盾。过去的三百多年的时间里，巴赫的音乐不是
第一次在希罗德·阿提库斯剧场响起，这一次也肯定不是
最后一次。
				<br><br><br>
跟其他几位音乐家相比，巴赫音乐工整的结构和平稳的节 奏沉着厚重，像一位庄严的长者。当灯光暗下去，全场焦 点集中在独自坐在舞台中央的马友友身上，他开始的拉动 弓弦，巴赫G大调第一大提琴序曲那段耳熟能详的旋律， 在这座有着两千年历史的剧场里，活泼的层层推进，显得
格外年轻。在赫尔墨斯的竖琴和雅典娜的长笛面前，巴赫
的羽管键琴哪里算什么古乐器?不单是巴赫，就连整个巴
洛克时期，对希罗德·阿提库斯剧场来说，都不过是一瞬
烟花。
				<br><br><br>
每个时代自有其热点，身处其中很难想象下一代会有多么
轻视当下的郑重。可不论当时多么举世瞩目、毁天灭地的
事件，放在整个人类文明的时间轴上，也都只能是耀眼火
花，转瞬即逝。
				<br><br><br>
ChatGPT已经能感知外界的声音和画面，甚至对方的情 绪，“Her”呼之欲出。埃隆·马斯克的机械臂成功夹住 火箭助推器，为“阿耳忒弥斯”新登月计划扫清了又一障 碍。人类对阿耳忒弥斯之美的浪漫向往，也许是从远古时 代某一个静谧的月夜就开始了，它不分时代，不论种族。 不管在当时看来有多么荒谬，难于登天，普罗米修斯的门 徒都没有停止过求索，路漫漫达数千年，终归会有实现的 时候。科技、经济、摩天大楼、电动汽车、人工智能，热 点总是朝向未来，但也总会有人尽其所能的留住历史的些 许痕迹，让大家有机会回望来路，感慨人类的渺小与浩 荡。
<br><br><br>

 贝多芬第二、第五交响曲·三重协奏曲坚决又鲜明的音乐
响起时，一开始只是少部分后排的观众挣脱了座椅的束
缚，鼓着掌站了起来，继而人们一排一排的站起，最后全
剧场五千多名观众集体起立，掌声像鞭炮一样全场炸开，
变成音乐节拍的一部分。
				<br><br><br>
在赵悠悠的职业生涯中，情绪被认为是反智的以及是女性
管理者的短板，情绪的表达在她过往的二十多年里受到严
格的训练，任何表达都需要有其明确的目的，单纯的个人
感受不会出现在工作场合。同事间看到的情绪，是经过校
准和提纯的产物，它需要具备事件的推动能力。可是当
下，看看眼前这些希腊观众吧，一会子忘情的鼓掌，一会
子深情的赞叹，一会子起来又坐下的，唯恐没能充分表达
自己的情绪。对他们来说，此刻唯一的任务就是允许音乐
跟情绪交融，让感受自由流淌，情绪不需要依附其他价
值，情绪存在本身就是意义。
				<br><br><br>
音乐架空了现实，氛围感染了心情，赵悠悠似乎也进入了
一种微醺的状态。她都不记得自己是怎么找到车，也不记
得回去的路是什么样的，脑子里只有灿烂的路灯，在车子
两边拉成长线。
<br><br><br>

 “我年轻的时候喜欢巴赫，整齐又悦耳。现在觉得好像能
够跟贝多芬共鸣了”赵悠悠边停车边跟儿子絮叨。
				<br><br><br>
“我喜欢贝多芬，他更有个性，情感更充沛一些”成煜臣
从小学钢琴，也喜欢古典音乐。
				<br><br><br>
“确实，巴赫属于理工男谱曲。照你这个偏好，也没见你
多喜欢帕格尼尼呀?”赵悠悠在锁上车，开始在包里翻找
钥匙。
				<br><br><br>
“帕格尼尼多邪性啊，我没那么偏激”成煜臣不以为然的
说。
				<br><br><br>
“那也不妨碍他好听，不过音乐确实能够反应人的性格倒
是”赵悠悠在包里没找到钥匙，继而开始全身上下捉虱。
				<br><br><br>
“帕格尼尼喜欢炫技嘛，你知道他得了马凡氏综合症吧”
成煜臣围着母亲绕圈，他的情绪也被音乐会加温，多少有
些亢奋。
<br><br><br>

 “你记得我们出门的时候锁门了吗?”赵悠悠没接茬。
“没印象，得马凡氏综合症的人手指都巨长”成煜臣没注
意到赵悠悠开始有些慌乱。她重新打开车门在车里反复搜
索。
				<br><br><br>
“我有一个坏消息，儿子”赵悠悠搜索未果，钻出车来对
儿子说。
				<br><br><br>
“忘带钥匙了?”成煜臣问道。
				<br><br><br>
“没错!我光想着化妆和怎么搭配衣服，出门忘了拿钥
匙。”赵悠悠低头看着自己踩着高跟鞋的光腿。深秋的雅
典不算冷，但也不是什么半夜穿着裙子呆在户外的季节。
“那我们现在怎么办?”成煜臣拉开车门钻回车里，虽然
不知道解决方案，但至少可以先启动节能模式。
<br><br><br>

 “在车上过一夜，或者找个民宿呆一晚，再或者...” 身处 异国他乡，举目无亲，即将流落街头...一想到这里，赵悠 悠振作起来，作出决定:好好想想办法!她抬头扫描着近 在咫尺却不得其门而入的家，突然眼前一亮，她看到自己 卧室的阳台，由于走的时候太匆忙，忘了放下卷帘门。
雅典的八月气温高达40度，依照传统，绝大部分居民都会 前往凉爽的岛屿或者其他国家消暑。这个时候的雅典，道 路空旷，商场关门，整个城市会进入“夏眠”。但上世纪 九十年代前后，由于东欧和巴尔干地区政治动荡，移民开 始涌入希腊，跟着本世纪初期，希腊加入欧盟，大量农村 人口随着城市化进程进入雅典。随着人口的暴增，人员结 构的变得越来越复杂。当度假归来的人们发现家里被洗劫 一空的时候，卷帘门这个小小的加固措施，成为家家户户 的标配。雅典夜不闭户的时代自此成为历史。
<br><br><br>
				赵悠悠没空追溯卷帘门的生平往事。她现在的思考重点是
如何才能破门而入?目测卧室阳台跟隔壁阳台间隔有一米
多宽，扶着墙一步就能跳过去。如果邻居，那个被她抹去
了姓名的人，能不见死不救，她也许不至于无家可归。更
何况，不管今晚去哪里，钥匙总不会自己飞出来，归根结
底还是要想法子开门进去不是?
<br><br><br>

 带着社会性微笑，深吸一口气，她按响了隔壁的门铃。过 了好久，终于听到有人噼里啪啦的在往外走，愤怒的吼 着:“Δεν ξέρεις με ποιον τα βάζεις!” 听声音判断大概是 “谁啊，大半夜的是要找死吗”之类的意思，门被猛的拉 开，头发蓬乱睡眼惺忪的斯皮罗斯出现在眼前。
“晚上好，亲爱的先生，非常非常的抱歉这么晚打扰你。 是这样的，我忘了带钥匙，我在想，我能不能从你的阳台 爬回我家...如果可以，那就真的是帮了我的大忙了”赵悠 悠努力让自己显得诚恳又可怜。
<br><br><br>
				斯皮罗斯面无表情，一言不发。约莫没睡醒，还在重启大
脑。也许他没听清自己的诉求?赵悠悠清了清喉咙，准备
再说一遍。斯皮罗斯上下打量了一下浓妆艳抹穿着小礼服
裙的赵悠悠，终于开口了:
<br><br><br>
				“不，公主殿下，你不能从我的阳台爬回你家”
<br><br><br>

 “为什么不行?我真的没带钥匙，请你帮帮忙，只要一分
钟。”赵悠悠交叉双手抱在胸前，摆出希腊人表达感恩的
姿势。
				<br><br><br>
“万一你掉下去摔死了，我可付不起这个责任!”斯皮罗
斯摆摆手，示意她赶紧离开。<br><br><br>
“我向你道歉，如果我曾在你车库门口停车堵住你，或者
万圣节时吓到了你⋯⋯”赵悠悠不肯放弃，扒着门框子努
力争取。<br><br><br>
“哦，哦，原来是你啊!你不说我还不知道是你，那么费
心弄了一大堆鬼东西，原来是专门为我准备的呀?”斯皮
罗斯眉飞色舞，装出一副恍然大悟的样子。<br><br><br>
“我很抱歉，那只是一个玩笑...”想到斯皮罗斯被贞子吓 的一蹦老高，惨绝人寰的大叫的场面，实在忍不住想笑。 赵悠悠用残存的理智维持住脸上痛心疾首悔不当初的表 情，然而斯皮罗斯完全不为所动。这个女人，已经被他焊 死在黑名单里!赵悠悠懊恼的想，早知道让儿子来跟他沟 通，说不定还能有点商量的余地。
<br><br><br>

 “我跟你说了不行，女士。现在已经是半夜了，你这是在
骚扰我。”斯皮罗斯掏出手机，开始翻找什么。<br><br><br>
不是吧，他之前报警摘了我的车牌，现在要报警告我骚扰
了吗?赵悠悠简直不敢相信，人真的可以这么记仇的吗?
她叹了口气，后退一步，开始盘算是不是可以去问楼上的
邻居，看看能不能从她家垂降下来。不过这样一来，摔死
的可能性就更大了。哎!<br><br><br>
“等等”斯皮罗斯对赵悠悠喊道。他拨通了电话，对着电
话那头叽里呱啦说了几句，跟着转向赵悠悠，说:“我给
你叫了个开锁的人，大概一二十分钟左右能到”<br><br><br>
赵悠悠有点懊悔自己过早的把诚恳又可怜的表情从脸上抹
去。这个人虽然态度恶劣，但至少还没有完全泯灭人性。
“不用谢，晚安”斯皮罗斯没等赵悠悠给出任何反馈，不
耐烦地挥了挥手，嘭的一声在她面前关上了门。
<br><br><br>

 开锁小哥几乎是哼着小曲骑摩托车过来的。他身形厚实，
圆脸带着轻松的微笑，把安全帽从头上摘下来的时候像小
狗一样甩了甩一头蓬松的金毛，犹如置身《壮志凌云》拍
摄现场。赵悠悠迎上前去，无不担忧的说:<br><br><br>
“我的门锁好像很难打开的样子，你不用带什么工具的
吗?”<br><br><br>
“别担心，女士，请相信我的专业性”他手拍胸口，强调
自己的可靠，空着两手跟赵悠悠来到家门前。<br><br><br>
“你出门的时候反锁了没有?”他摸了摸锁眼问道。<br><br><br>
“我印象中没有锁门，我应该是忘了带钥匙出门”赵悠悠 在脑子里再次搜索了出门的场景，该死的是，当时光想着 要怎么打扮才好看，才配得上华丽的音乐会。其实剧场黑 洞洞的，也不知道是打扮了给谁看，难道是要致敬马友友 和巴赫吗?也不知道他们二位收到自己代价惨重的 respect没有?
<br><br><br>

 开锁小哥盯着门锁，交抱双臂，手摸鼻梁，释放出一个表
示很难办的深呼吸。赵悠悠不无担心的问:“怎么?这个
锁是不是不好开?我就说嘛”<br><br><br>
小哥摇了摇头，亲切的盯着赵悠悠，问道:“100欧，开 不开?”<br><br><br>
“开，开!”赵悠悠放下心中大石忙不迭的回应。<br><br><br>
开锁小哥从裤兜掏出一个小铁片，伸进门缝里捣鼓了几
下，总共耗时大概十秒钟，欺软怕硬的大门豁然洞开。一
瞬间，露宿街头的恐慌解除，失而复得的家的温暖怀抱让
人心怀感恩。<br><br><br>
真是技多不压身呐，我也想当个开锁匠。赵悠悠感慨的想 道。一边从钱包里拿出两张50欧大钞，递给开锁小哥。小 哥接过钱，带着嘲弄的笑容揣进口袋。
“晚安，公主殿下”他手指从额头挥出，做了个敬礼手
势，转身离去。赵悠悠忽然明白了什么，斯皮罗斯不单给
<br><br><br>

 她谈了个“好价钱”，还给她起了个造作的外号四处传
播。得，君子报仇，十年不晚。赵悠悠进屋把包扔到桌
上，踢掉高跟鞋倒在沙发上。这一晚的起伏跌宕，悲喜交
加令人疲惫不堪，且容我今晚睡个好觉先。
<br><br><br>

 <h3>5.共享猫 </h3>

根据动物爱好者社区的统计，希腊大约有四百万只无家可
归的动物。<br><br><br>
“你知道吗?十年前雅典是没有鹦鹉的”赵悠悠和插画家
雅尼斯在国家公园瞎溜达，雅尼斯对她说。彼时他们刚上
完同一个网球教练的课，背着拍子从俱乐部走出来。雅尼
斯是一个有着非常典型希腊面孔的中年人，高而挺拔的身
材，黑色短卷发，不费吹灰之力就拥有的希腊式直鼻，哪
哪儿都很标准，但又不大好称之为帅。帅需要有特殊气质
的加持。<br><br><br>
彼时一大堆鹦鹉正在羊圈后面的树上开会议事，叽叽喳
喳，热火朝天。大概是十年前的某一天，某对鹦鹉从笼子
里逃出来，花了三千多天的时间，这披红挂绿的鸟儿一举
占领了雅典的大小树林。<br><br><br>
公园的水池中央是一个人造迷你小岛，上面密密麻麻的爬
满陆龟，小岛活像长满了鳞片。雅典满大街都是食材。素
的有橘子、柠檬、无花果，全都结的满满当当，成熟以后
<br><br><br>

 掉一地。荤的有乌龟和鸽子，全都不慌不忙，到处溜达。
希腊人抱怨无花果从三块涨价到七块，路边树上多的是，
但还是要抱怨，也不摘。<br><br><br>
第一次从大规模起飞的鸽群下走过时，赵悠悠很担心天上
会掉“炸弹”下来。可鸽群似乎已经拥有了与人共生的智
慧，很少用粪便袭击人类。他们定点排泄，在有些公允的
区域，鸽粪密密麻麻。<br><br><br>
最大规模的无家可归的动物，是猫。希腊有三百万只流浪
猫，大多聚集在雅典、萨罗尼基一类的大城市里。在雅
典，你可以不需要有自己的猫，到处都是共享猫，只要你
愿意喂，天天都有得喂。这些毛色各异的欧洲短毛猫，成
群结队，在人类社区间成体系的过着半野生生活。他们被
人类和人类垃圾饥一顿饱一顿拉扯大。每只猫都拥有自己
的垃圾桶奶妈，随机投喂养母，餐厅施舍教母。至于住宿
嘛，从山上披着绿网子的野外猫舍，到大楼门前旧枕头缝
的睡榻，虽然无家可归，倒也不至于没床可睡。关于如何
分配这些物资，没人知道。不管他们彼此斗争的有多惨
烈，一旦有人的身影出现，所有战斗一律停止。全体猫员
立正，行注目礼。即便来人没有带吃的，也万不可做出失
望或死缠烂打的样子来，必须以得体的姿态目送人类走
远，再继续鬼吼辣叫的撕打。
				<br><br><br>
没有人真正拥有它们，也没有人对它们的猫生负责。猫生
而自由，爱干嘛干嘛。人也自由，想喂喂，不想喂它们也
不会因此饿死。这是一种人与动物的非契约性共生关系。
动物享有自由，人类则提供非约束性质的帮助。双方听凭
自由意志行事，同时保持本分节制。
				<br><br><br>
“这或许是民主最理想的样子。”赵悠悠看着一只陆龟没
踩稳，从另一只陆龟背上滚落到小岛下面的水池里，说
道。<br><br><br>
“民主?你认为民主是理想的施政纲领吗?”雅尼斯冷笑
了一声。<br><br><br>
“我不知道，你们西方世界不整天都在拿民主说事儿吗?
说起来，希腊还是民主的诞生地呢。”赵悠悠。
<br><br><br>

 “看看希腊现在是什么样子?我们拥有欧洲最长的工作时
长，但平均收入在全欧洲排名倒数。这就是民主带来的一
盘散沙。”雅尼斯举起自己的小手指，愤慨的说。<br><br><br>
这不是赵悠悠第一次听希腊人表达对当前民意松散，政府
施政不力的不满。意见的分散，决策的拖泥带水，使得这
个国家在方方面面举步维艰。中产阶级幻想着中央集权式
的管理能够解决问题。<br><br><br>
“这也许就是我们中国人说的，物极必反。过去几十年， 世界一直在向“右”发展，当自由散漫拖累了经济的发 展，大家开始向往“左”的力量与高效” 赵悠悠感慨道。
<br><br><br>“给你举个例子。前一段时间我打算购买一套房子，前提 是我跟我的会计师和所有银行都沟通过，银行已经保证我 一定可以得到贷款。可是在我付完定金之后，房东在正式 的合同里加了好多条附加条款。其中一条你听听:如果希 腊所有银行都倒闭，而导致贷款无法发放，买方需要向卖 方赔偿2万欧元。你敢相信这是真的吗?”
<br><br><br>

 “这怎么可能?希腊的银行会在几个月内全部倒闭?”赵
悠悠也觉得匪夷所思。<br><br><br>
“房东说:万一呢?哪怕只有百万分之一的可能性，也得
写进合同。理论上，她确实可以这么做。但你认为，这是
一种有效的契约方式吗?”雅尼斯说道。<br><br><br>
“在中国，我们使用统一的合同模板，有标准化流程。我 们使用的是“苹果系统”。而你们使用的是“安卓系统”， 什么都要DIY。所以才会出现这种乱七八糟的情况。”赵 悠悠一边说着一边感到好奇，那个房东这么做的用意。
“这就是所谓的自由民主”雅尼斯手一摊，一副让赵悠悠
评评理的样子。<br><br><br>
“可是她为什么要这么做呢?”赵悠悠没想出答案。<br><br><br>
“我也不知道，我有一个猜测是，她用这些条款来逼我毁
约，这样就可以拿走我的定金”雅尼斯解释说。<br><br><br>


 确实，在复杂多变的人性面前，各自为营的民主常常让人
举步维艰。也许只有那些流浪猫，才能真正享受民主带来
的好处吧。赵悠悠不禁羡慕起那些无家可归的猫咪来。
“我在想民主的优雅实现需要建立在两个基本条件之上:<br><br><br> 1.物资不短缺;<br><br><br>2.供需双方守本分，不贪婪。<br><br><br>北欧是不是 比较符合这个条件?”她说道。<br><br><br>
“北欧更像是共产主义。不过你说的对，任何理想状态的
实现都离不开最基本的经济条件。这一点希腊应该向中国
学习，把赚钱作为最重要的策略来实施。”雅尼斯略有些
愤世嫉俗的说。<br><br><br>
“现在只有猫咪可以当第欧根尼，对吧?” 赵悠悠说。第 欧根尼是希腊著名的哲学家。据说他住在一个木桶里。有 一次他正在晒太阳，亚历山大大帝前来拜访他，问他想要 什么，并保证会兑现他的愿望。第欧根尼回答道:“我希 望你闪一边去，别挡着我的阳光”。亚历山大大帝说: “我如果不是亚历山大，我愿意是第欧根尼”
<br><br><br>
 “哈哈哈，没错” 雅尼斯无奈的笑了。
除了民主和哲学，希腊还是西方戏剧的发源地。早在公元
前五世纪，雅典就诞生了悲剧和喜剧两大喜剧形式。
赵悠悠第一次跟希腊人在网上讨论起各自国家文化底色的 时候，对方说:“希腊人的底是酒神文化” 一开始赵悠悠 对酒神的认知仅限于欲望、狂欢，今朝有酒今朝醉的生活 态度。但后来发现，酒神文化远不止于此。希腊悲剧就诞 生于酒神的祭祀。作为享乐主义的代表，酒神的祭祀舞会 是一场天性解放的盛会。人们披着山羊皮唱歌跳舞、吃生 羊肉，喝葡萄酒，极尽所能的释放本能。但颂唱表演的却 是古希腊英雄悲壮的故事。对自然和诸神的敬畏，对不屈 精神的赞颂，以狂欢的形式，表达渺小人类的无畏与不 羁，如此种种，复杂的交织在一起。
现代英语里的“悲剧”Tragedy就是从古希腊语Tragodie 演变而来的，它的意思是“山羊之歌”。古希腊人认为悲 剧的内核是严肃和高尚的。亚里士多德曾经曰过:“悲剧 是对严肃，完美，宏大行为的模仿。”在这个底之上的希 腊人，不论如何狂放、恣意而为，终归还是带着某种终极 的苍凉与持重。

 在《伊利亚特》里，在特洛伊战争中，带领希腊联军阿伽
门农抢走了著名将领阿基琉斯的女伴及战利品，使得阿基
琉斯受辱愤而拒绝出战，导致阿基琉斯的好友帕特罗克洛
斯被杀。最终阿基琉斯怒而决定披挂上阵，在重回战场后
抵住了特洛伊人的进攻并且杀死凶手，继而战死疆场。<br><br><br>
在《战国策》里，秦国灭赵后，兵锋直指燕国南界，荆轲
献计太子丹，要拿秦国叛将樊於期的头及燕督亢地图进献
秦王，相机行刺。太子丹不忍杀樊於期，荆轲只好私见樊
於期，告以实情，樊於期为成全荆轲自刎。荆轲带燕督亢
地图和樊於期首级，前往秦国刺杀秦王。临行前，众人在
易水边为荆轲送行，高渐离击筑，荆轲和而歌曰“风萧萧
兮易水寒，壮士一去兮不复还”。最终荆轲刺秦王不中，
被秦王拔剑击成重伤后为秦侍卫所杀。<br><br><br>
“亦余心之所善兮，虽九死其犹未悔”超越个人生死，知
其不可为而为之的力量对中国人来说并不陌生，这也许是
历史悠久的国度相似的地方。也可能正是因为有了这样超
越人性的壮烈，才使得各自的精神和文明得以延绵几千年
不断绝。
<br><br><br>

 流淌在血液里的戏剧天份，使得希腊人天生善于表演，和
中国人习惯意会和神交不一样，希腊人喜欢用肢体、语言
及表情来表达情感和想法。他们的表演天赋甚至跨越物
种，在流浪猫身上也得到了充分的体现。<br><br><br>希腊的流浪猫，
那可不是普通的猫，它们都是猫精，是奥斯卡影帝影后。
赵悠悠刚搬到新住所的时候就注意到那两只奶牛猫，一大
一小，白底狸花，都留着“中分刘海”，在隔壁的院子里
进进出出。斯皮罗斯每天早晚都会出来投喂它们，超大的
食盆里，装着各种无法辨认原材料的食物。流浪猫对食物
的包容度极大，它们喜欢人类的餐食超过猫粮，但隔壁的
大食盆不时还是会有食物剩下，很显然要不就是供给过
量，要不就是不宜食用。<br><br><br>
没多久这两只猫就开始出现在赵悠悠的门口。她第一次注
意到它们的到访是在搬过来两天后，她正在厨房做晚饭的
时候。那只楚楚可怜的大猫，端端正正的坐在她厨房的玻
璃门前，抬着橄榄绿的大眼睛，含情脉脉的看着她。而那
只小猫则不安分的在远处的角落里上蹿下跳。<br><br><br>
“邻居的猫过来认门了”赵悠悠大声对房间里的儿子说。
				<br><br><br>
 “它要干嘛?”成煜臣从房间里出来，看了一眼规规矩矩
蹲在门口的大猫。<br><br><br>
“大概是打个招呼吧”赵悠悠看着大猫，它可真是一只清 秀漂亮的猫，骨相匀称，毛发飘逸，有几分缅因猫的模 样。更了不起的是，它居然接住了赵悠悠的眼神，歪着脑 袋，跟她对视，进行起“眼神交流”来。赵悠悠当时正在 出神的盘算晚餐的鱼香肉丝里蛋白质可能不太够，是不是 再加个青椒炒蛋，神态多少有些呆滞。而大猫的“眼神” 里带着观察、理解、祈求、忍耐、接受...等等复杂的情绪， 一时间，她分不清自己跟那只猫，谁更像是人类。
大猫跟赵悠悠眼神对接成功，嗲嗲的叫了一声，继而卧倒
在地，把爪子揣进怀里。一副要打算久坐的架势。赵悠悠
说:<br><br><br>
“那好吧，我做饭啦，你随意”<br><br><br>
猫咪好像没有什么语言障碍，心领神会的喵了一声。
<br><br><br>

 直到赵悠悠做好饭，跟儿子两人吃完，回到厨房，它还在
那里。一脸平静与乖巧，没有丝毫的埋怨与催促。<br><br><br>
“客人都坐到这个份上了，恐怕还是要给点吃的才能送走
吧”赵悠悠对儿子说。<br><br><br>
“给它吃什么?我们又没有猫粮”成煜臣把剩菜放到灶台
上。<br><br><br>
“那就吃点剩饭剩菜吧。”赵悠悠舀了一勺子米饭放到鱼
香肉丝的汤汁里，拌了拌，装到超市装猪肉的塑料盒里，
开门出去。<br><br><br>
大猫闻声立刻结束静坐冥想，起身跟着赵悠悠一路小跑来
到院子中央。赵悠悠把饭放下，它上前闻了闻，蹲到了一
边。 <br><br><br>
“它会不会不喜欢吃中餐啊?”成煜臣问。
<br><br><br>

 “我也不知道，它是不是不喜欢醋的酸味?你说咱们要不
要把这个倒掉重新换点别的?”赵悠悠有些奇怪并下意识
的后退一步。<br><br><br>
看到赵悠悠退后，大猫这才走近猫碗，低头伸舌头在空气
里舔了两下，它的舌头甚至都没碰到猫饭，猫影后假装吃
了两口抬起头来喵了一声，看表情像是:太好吃了，感谢
你。<br><br><br>
“它在表演吃饭吗这是?”赵悠悠掏出手机，不知道是该
查:猫是不是不能吃醋?还是查:猫会表演吃饭吗?<br><br><br>
这时小猫从不知道什么角落飞快的窜出，一头扎进塑料盒
里，开始狼吞虎咽。大猫这才又抬起头来，和赵悠悠对视
一眼，似乎是在表达感激。没错，赵悠悠确信那是感谢的
眼神。大猫表达完毕优雅的低下头，有一口没一口的跟小
猫一同吃起来。果然天下母亲都是一样的，为了给孩子留
口吃的真是煞费苦心。
<br><br><br>

 至此这对不速之客理所当然的移居到了赵悠悠的院子里，
早晚请安，饭毕退朝。隔壁的猫饭盆变得门可罗雀，无猫
问津。<br><br><br>
自打跟这俩母子认识之后，赵悠悠对附近的猫开始熟悉起
来。一只健壮的奶牛猫，花色跟家里这对母子如出一辙，
小猫常常跟着它在垃圾桶旁边的荒地里闯荡。赵悠悠管它
叫“大舅”，“大舅”有个三花女朋友，常年伴随左右。
一只橘猫像是随从，不时一起在垃圾桶里觅食。另外有只
肥硕的黑猫，孤独的游离在猫群之外，神色警觉，犹如黑
豹。<br><br><br>
“猫帮”似乎有自己的帮派规矩和各自的领地，它们偶尔
在荒地里撕打，发出惨叫。但天一亮，又三两成堆，相安
无事。每当给奶牛猫母子喂骨头的时候，猫妈妈总会按耐
不住的喉咙发出呜咽，等到赵悠悠放下骨头，退后一步，
它立刻跑上来，叼起一块骨头飞奔出院子，过一会儿才回
来吃剩下的。像是某种上贡仪式。<br><br><br>
早上，赵悠悠照例在阳台喝咖啡，收发邮件，在希腊虽然
大家也用即时通讯工具，但大部分事务性的沟通，仍通过
邮件进行。它给了对接的工作人缓冲的时间，一件普通的
<br><br><br>

 事情往往要等两三天才会有答复。一开始赵悠悠也感到不
习惯，常常忘记看邮件，要不就是因为某个问题得不到及
时的回答而感到焦虑。但时间长了，慢慢也就适应了希腊
这种“虽迟但到”的风格。说到底，人生有多少事情是非
要得到答复的呢?很多事即便没有回答，不了了之，好像
也不打紧。<br><br><br>
就在她发送完关于银行卡为何迟迟未到的查询邮件之后，
“大舅”蹑手蹑脚的跑进了院子，径直走向她喂猫的塑料
盒子，躺在一边的猫妈妈看到它，扭开头看风景。“大
舅”低下猫帮领袖高昂的头颅，吃起奶牛猫母子的剩饭
来。这时楼上的狗忽然叫了几声，猫妈妈闻声转头，发现
赵悠悠正盯着“大舅”在吃她的法定配餐。<br><br><br>
猫妈妈石化了半秒，一骨碌爬起来，低声呵斥“大舅”，
一副声色俱厉的样子。“大舅”见状一溜烟跑了。猫妈妈
表演工作完毕，抬起她含情脉脉的绿眼睛看着赵悠悠，大
概是在说:我跟它不熟，刚没注意到这家伙来偷吃，请原
谅我的疏忽。<br><br><br>
不管演技如何出色，赵宅护院猫假公济私的工作态度已经
被赵悠悠尽收眼底。当初该不会是被隔壁给辞退的吧?她
<br><br><br>
 望向远处的隔壁的猫盆，黑黄色食物装满一盆，几只虫子
在上空盘旋，它们倒是不挑，赵悠悠心想。看这情形，猫
妈妈应该是主动从那边辞职的。<br><br><br>
猫妈妈对秩序奉若圭皋。而她的儿子，小奶牛猫则是个吊
儿郎当的主儿。好好的路不走，图省事要在窄窄的护栏上
走猫步，失足掉到橘子树上，爬起来继续。没人的时候跳
上阳台的椅子，舒舒服服的躺下，摊开肚子晒太阳。更没
形没状的是，有时候它连饭都懒得站着吃，吃着吃着就在
饭盒边躺下来，吃一口歇一歇。<br><br><br>
“真不愧是希腊啊，连只野猫都在奉行伊壁鸠鲁感官享乐
的主张”赵悠悠从来没见过这么放飞自我的猫。但当猫妈
妈在旁边的时候，小的种种怪谲就会被严格约束。猫妈妈
会把它从阳台椅子上赶下来。在等饭等的不耐烦的用爪子
开始抓挠纱门的时候，一巴掌给它拍老实。<br><br><br>
斯多葛派的猫妈妈坚持“美德是唯一的善”。它拥有极强
的耐心，进退有度。不管多饿也绝不挠门，不在人离开饭
盒之前进食。在小猫跟着大舅野地瞎晃的时候把它撵回
“家”。它甚至会在赵悠悠给了它们比较丰盛的晚饭之
 后，把饭盒子舔干净，在里面放上一片叶子或者一朵小
花。<br><br><br>
“这只猫一定是在对我们进行PUA，用这种方式激励我们 给她提供更好的食物。”赵悠悠对这一善意持怀疑态度， 她不以为然的成煜臣说。
<br><br><br>“猫会捉老鼠和虫子来表达感谢，不过花花草草就不确定
是怎么回事了。”成煜臣的科学小课堂一向很严谨。<br><br><br>
“我每次跟她对视，都会被她硬控好一会儿。我有时候觉
得真的被她操纵了”正悠闲地趴在花园草垫上晒太阳的两
只猫大概被两人的聊天吵醒，勉强睁开眼喵了个招呼。<br><br><br>
“我觉得你想多了，妈妈。它们应该只是单纯的表达感激
而已。”成煜臣把叠好的纸飞机从阳台上飞到院子里。<br><br><br>
飞机降落在橘子树上，太阳暖洋洋，四叶草在风里轻轻摇
晃，对啊，除了单纯地表达感激，还能是什么?
<br><br><br>

 那是从什么时候开始，简单的善意变得不那么简单了?是
从第一次被骗、被伤害开始的吗?她记起，自己微信里还
躺着几个借钱不还“犹如死了“的“老熟人”，比金钱损
失更令人失望的是，他们原本是朋友。更别提在过往职业
生涯中的种种博弈。她甚至一度认为道德只是弱者的一厢
情愿，在强者的世界里，盲目相信是智力缺陷。这里只有
权衡、制约、交换和胜负。她认为生活就像是一盘中国象
棋，遍布着“牵制”、“兑子”、“逼宫”和“将军”!<br><br><br>
所谓的卷，实际上只是在争取某种主动权，当你抢占有利
地势的时候，才能不那么容易地被他人所制约。<br><br><br>
她来希腊买房办黄金签证，也不出意外的被友好又亲切的 中介黑了不少钱，出售房产的希腊房东找上门来，告诉她 自己收到的房款只是她付款的80%，房东怂恿赵悠悠去法 院上诉告中介，她没有答应。除开对希腊办事的拖沓与不 确定性的厌倦，她更不愿面对的是人们在利益面前撕破脸 的丑陋。“归根结底他们帮了我，就当是额外的手续费 吧”她对房东说。房东对此完全不能理解，传统的希腊人 是非常讲“义气”及在乎“兄弟情义”的，但也许是在这 经济垮塌的二十年，所有人的金钱观都开始变得保守而谨 慎，爱情诚可贵，义气价更高，若为利益故，二者皆可 抛。
<br><br><br>

 与此相对的，是来到这里的“有钱的中国人”逐渐放下了
对金钱的执念，也许是周围华人多一事不如少一事的氛围
使然，也许是经济状况的相对宽裕，带来了松弛平和的态
度。希腊并不与世无争，与世无争的是在这里有时你可以
选择不那么狰狞的活着。<br><br><br>
尼采说:“你欺骗了我，我并没有因此失去什么。我失去
的只是，我本以为你是一个诚实的人。”金钱的损失可以
看淡，但如果因此失去的，是对外界善意的相信与接纳，
那么“坏人”说不定真的赢了呢?<br><br><br>
“温柔是一种自上而下的情感。”赵悠悠没头没脑的说。
“你这句话上下文不挨着。”成煜臣吐槽道。<br><br><br>
“你看这只猫，虽然无家可归，到处讨饭，但没准她的精
神世界远远高于我们。”<br><br><br>


 “那可不，希腊的猫嘛，可能都懂点哲学什么的。”<br><br><br>
猫们好像听懂了他们说的话，一起转过头来，又轻轻的喵
了一声。<br><br><br>


 <h3>6.犹太邻居 </h3>
<br><br><br>
赵悠悠给猫弄了两个碗。<br><br><br>
希腊酸奶冠绝天下。经典的希腊酸奶既不是液态的，也没
添加增稠剂来凝固，除开使用的是富含高蛋白的优质奶源
之外，制作方法也独树一帜:它通过过滤去除大量乳清而
形成浓稠质地。超市里有一种传统的希腊酸奶是装在砖红
色土陶碗里羊奶酸奶。它的酸味更浓，质地更轻薄，加入
蜂蜜和面包一起吃，风味一绝。而装它的土陶碗就是希腊
大街小巷的流浪猫的专用猫碗。<br><br><br>
为了这两个碗，赵悠悠大吃了两天羊酸奶。<br><br><br>
“一旦有了猫碗，是不是就等于正式收养它了?”成煜臣
问妈妈。<br><br><br>
“我不知道算不算，谁知道隔壁对它们有没有监护权”赵
悠悠正在把猪肥肉切成小块炼油渣。猪油和油渣撒上一点
虾皮，用来拌饭给猫吃，没有猫能拒绝这个美味。
<br><br><br>

 “如果隔壁已经收养了它们，我们为什么还要喂它们?”
“为了中餐的骄傲!”赵悠悠脱口而出。<br><br><br>
问:什么样的人适合移居海外?<br><br><br>
答:会做饭的人。<br><br><br>
不管走到世界哪个角落，只要有华人的地方，就有中国
菜。刚到希腊的时候，赵悠悠陷入了烹饪困局。中式调料
一概没有。出于动物福祉的考虑，希腊的猪没有经过阉
割，猪肉常带着腥臊味儿。她经过坚持不懈的搜索询问，
终于跟中超接上了头，八角花椒草果应有尽有，油盐酱醋
以及中国人养的土猪肉全都置办齐全之后，小赵“中餐
馆”正式挂牌营业。<br><br><br>
尽管每天只招待一位顾客，她依旧兢兢业业，花样百出。
尽管如此，一身本领还是没能得到充分发挥，直到两个不
 请自来的客人闯入他们的生活，不单不挑食，还懂得感
恩，赵悠悠得到知音，每天都会花一点时间，兴致勃勃的
煮一碗猫饭给它们吃。<br><br><br>
“你在给他们吃什么?闻起来好香”<br><br><br>
赵悠悠住的楼里有七户人家，平时她和邻居们没什么往
来。直到有天，有人在她院子里跟她打招呼，一口好听的
英伦腔。她蹲在地上抬头看去，一个大概五十出头的男
人，穿着冲锋衣和靴子，一副风尘仆仆的样子。晒得黝黑
的脸上露出友好的微笑，调皮的虎牙让整个人显得活泼而
亲切。<br><br><br>
“上午好，我是七楼的住户。我叫阿尔伯特，我来自英
国，最近准备打理一下这个房子搬过来住。你是新来的邻
居吗?接下来你应该会常常看见我”一听这个阿尔伯特属
于话很多的类型。<br><br><br>
“上午好，是的，我住这里。我叫悠悠。欢迎”赵悠悠起
身退后一步，奶牛猫母子迅速上前开始暴风卷入。
<br><br><br>

 “它们对你的食物真的是狂热，你是个专业厨师吗?你做
的是什么?”阿尔伯特对猫们流露出不加掩饰的羡慕。希
腊人大多都会英语，但多少都带些口音。赵悠悠不是英语
母语者，有时会听得有些吃力。而阿尔伯特流畅的英语，
每个字颗粒感都很清晰，仿佛自己英语水平忽然提高了似
得。<br><br><br>
“是的，我是专门的猫厨师，我拿过猫饭证书，还得过猫
饭竞赛的奖呢”话痨阿尔伯特带着某种让人放松的特质，
赵悠悠仿佛受到了感染，胡乱开起玩笑来。<br><br><br>
“我知道了，一定是料理鼠王Rémy在教你做饭，这样一 来猫就不吃老鼠了”阿尔伯特接着她的话头也一本正经的 胡说八道起来。
<br><br><br>“我们猫饭竞赛上，普罗旺斯杂烩可是输给了中国的四喜
金樽狮子头。”阿尔伯特竟然还看过料理鼠王，想来家里
也有小孩子。
<br><br><br>

 “我有没有机会吃这个什么姜汁寿司?我可以为此加入猫
籍”阿尔伯特显然不知道什么是四喜金樽狮子头。<br><br><br>
“哈哈，中国可没有什么姜汁寿司，我给人类做的都是普 通的家常便饭，如果你不介意，随时欢迎” 希腊人对中餐 并不像其他国家那么热衷，这个英国人倒是识货。
<br><br><br>“真的可以吗?什么时候呢?我是认真问的。我是犹太 人，不能吃猪肉，其他的中餐我统统都爱” 跟赵悠悠认识 的相对保守和自持的希腊人相比，这个阿尔伯特真的是太 不见外了，也许是走南闯北见得多，世界大同了。
<br><br><br>“啊哟，你还点上菜了啊，得，周六晚上来我们家吃完饭
吧。普通家常菜，不要过度预期”赵悠悠觉得这人怪有意
思的。人与人之间磁场要是对得上的话，不管沟通什么都
简单又愉快。<br><br><br>
周六一早阿尔伯特就在手机上跟赵悠悠确认吃饭时间，需
不需要带什么手信，以及有没有什么需要注意的礼节。他
发消息比说话礼貌客气得多，英式绕七绕八的客套颇为有
趣。赵悠悠自然回复不需要带礼物，没什么需要注意的，
<br><br><br>

 诸如此类。她又根据冰箱里的库存情况，拟了一个菜单发
过去，红烧牛肉、番茄炒蛋、宫保鸡丁、干锅土豆、蚝油
生菜和奶油南瓜汤。阿尔伯特十之八九看不懂，但赵悠悠
乐于搞这个形式。<br><br><br>
夹着雪花丝的牛腩用开水焯过，放姜片、葱段，八角和香
叶炒出香味加酱油小火炖着。赵悠悠喜欢在里面加几粒藤
椒，一开始只是用来给猪肉去腥，但后来发现藤椒特有的
清香别有一番风味。最后她连炒青菜都加藤椒，逐渐四川
化。<br><br><br>
希腊的番茄个头匀称，味道鲜美，是所谓“老品种”，带
着浓郁的番茄特有的酸甜。鸡蛋也一样，这里阳光充足，
一切食材都仿佛味道加浓了，只需要打撒煎黄，再把番茄
煮出汁水混到里面，除了盐不需要其他调料，就是百吃不
厌的家常菜。<br><br><br>
宫保鸡丁算是一道保险菜，去过中餐馆吃饭的人十之八九
都吃过。不会有太大的预期误差。希腊的青葱有种特殊的
香味，没有太大硫化物味道，加了油炸花生米和干辣椒，
拿蚝油生抽老抽糖醋兑的芡汁一收，盛在描金瓷盘里，秒
杀餐厅的出品。
<br><br><br>

 干锅土豆加了炸薄荷增加味觉记忆点、罗马生菜白灼以后
依旧脆爽、奶油南瓜汤的秘诀是炒软的洋葱和炸焦的蒜
蓉。总共耗时不到两小时，桌布刚铺上，门铃就响了。
阿尔伯特是个实诚人，真的什么也没带，空着两手就来
了。中国人扎根土地，待客之道诚恳务实，犹太人漂泊四
海，没必要不花钱，有必要逮着理由能不花也不花。
“你说不用带礼物，我寻思着如果带的话可能不得体，就
真的没带”不但如此，他还先倒打一耙。<br><br><br>
“我们中国人有句话，叫做“礼多人不怪”虽然是指礼
貌，但我可以修正为“礼物”，下次想带什么尽管带，别
拘着”赵悠悠一本正经的说。<br><br><br>
“是真的吗?下次你需要什么告诉我，我一定带”阿尔伯
特也换上严肃脸。
<br><br><br>

 “真的可以吗?我需要一台辣妈咖啡机，你带吧”赵悠悠
最近对自己的咖啡机颇为嫌弃。做意式出来的差不多是美
式。<br><br><br>
“辣妈咖啡机，多少钱?”阿尔伯特没想到赵悠悠真的狮
子大张口。<br><br><br>
“大概也就小一万欧元吧”赵悠悠哈哈大笑。她之前在国
内还真有一台。<br><br><br>
“你的这顿晚饭要把我吃破产了”阿尔伯特摆出可怜的神
情。<br><br><br>
“没事，吃完你可以假装咱们不认识，以后不来的话就可
以不用送啦”赵悠悠一面往桌子上放餐具一面说。<br><br><br>
“那我今天要好好吃饱，免得都吃不到了”阿尔伯特在成
煜臣对面坐下来。
<br><br><br>

 “阿尔伯特先生，最近以色列和巴勒斯坦打仗，你是怎么
看的?”成煜臣听说阿尔伯特是犹太人，一直很想问他这
个问题。中国不像西方世界，除了美国其他一边倒的都在
谴责以色列。如同俄乌战争一样，两边都有各自的支持
者。西方的网络媒体出于自身利益的关系，所谓的客观和
中立已经荡然无存，媒体主导的政治正确在暴力清除着不
一样的声音。反倒是在中国，能够看到两种对立的观点同
时出现。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠没想到成煜臣会问这个问题，虽然她不认为此时此
刻是讨论这种敏感的政治问题的最佳时间，但她很高兴成
煜臣能够有这个好奇心，同时她也很想知道，从犹太人自
己的眼睛里来看，这场战争究竟是什么立场?<br><br><br>
“我们在跟一群崇拜死亡的魔鬼交战”阿尔伯特还没拿起
筷子呢，就当头迎来这个问题。情绪一下子就上来了。
“崇拜死亡?”成煜臣重复阿尔伯特的话。<br><br><br>
“是的他们根本就不怕死。我们只是想要把我们的人解救
回来。所有的报道只看到我们炸毁了他们的医院啊，他们
的小孩子站在废墟里哭啊。那我们的人呢?一开始他们就
残忍的杀死我们的人，这里面也有小孩，也有妇女。我们
要带他们回家”阿尔伯特掏出脖子上的一个军牌，给成煜
臣看。告诉他上面写的希伯来语就是“带他们回家”。跟
着他问成煜臣:
				<br><br><br>
“如果是你，你的家人，好友，你的同胞，被敌人打死，
抓走，你是不是也会不计代价的要把他们救回来?”<br><br><br>
“应该...会吧”成煜臣略有迟疑的回答到。他阅读到的材料是巴勒斯坦被报复的很惨，加沙已经被炸成一片废墟。 可以色列还是不肯停手。但当他面对一个真人，在他面前 义正言辞的认为这是应该的，自己代入角色一想，如果自己也摊上这个事情，说不定也会同样的愤怒以及渴望报复，如果中国人被这样杀死并绑架，他肯定也会赞同要战斗到最后一刻。如此看来，世界上就没有绝对的是非对 错、正义与否。
<br><br><br>战争本来就是强者游戏，整个人类社会亦是如此。二战的种族大屠杀中有600万手无寸铁的犹太人被杀死，战后幸 存下来的几百万犹太人在巴勒斯坦地区建国，一步一步的 把沙漠变成了高科技现代化城市，跟着一寸一寸的蚕食巴


 勒斯坦人的土地，犹太人的强权和巴勒斯坦人的反抗一次 又一次的升级为战争。直到最近的巴以冲突。2023年10 月，哈马斯发动袭击，杀死了一千多个以色列平民并绑架 了两百多名以色列人和外国人，而接下来一年多的战争 里，哈马斯的根据地加沙被夷为平地，巴勒斯坦伤亡超过 十五万人。
<br><br><br>
				“你猜全世界有多少穆斯林?又有多少犹太人?”阿尔伯
特问成煜臣。
<br><br><br>“不清楚”成煜臣老实回答。
<br><br><br>“全世界有20亿穆斯林，但只有1500万犹太人”阿尔伯特说。
<br><br><br>这个数字连赵悠悠都觉得震惊，她一直认为犹太人数量远
超于此。
<br><br><br>“你知道全世界获得诺贝尔奖最多的是什么人吗?”阿尔
伯特接着又问。
<br><br><br>
 “这个我知道，全世界有百分之二十多的诺贝尔奖是犹太
人获得的”成煜臣答上了这个知识点。
<br><br><br>“不光是诺贝尔奖获得者，耶稣、马克思、爱因斯坦、洛 克菲勒、毕加索、摩根、巴菲特、弗洛伊德、海涅、卡夫 卡...全是犹太人”。
<br><br><br>“还有奥本海默、费曼和扎克伯格”成煜臣兴奋的说，他
<br><br><br>刚看了电影《奥本海默》，以及费曼的《发现的乐趣》这
本书。
<br><br><br>“看，他们都是犹太人”阿尔伯特眉飞色舞，还专门看了 一眼赵悠悠，简直骄傲的不得了。赵悠悠笑了笑，往阿尔 伯特和自己面前的红酒杯里倒了一些来自伯罗奔尼撒半岛 的Fleva。
<br><br><br>“我没想到犹太人数量那么少，你们应该为人类的发展多
生点孩子，我了不起的犹太客人”赵悠悠一边说一边递给
 成煜臣一瓶可乐，他打开倒到自己杯子里。赵悠悠并举起
杯子示意大家开饭。
				<br><br><br>
“感谢美丽的女主人和聪明的小主人，很荣幸能来作客”
阿尔伯特和成煜臣也举起了杯子。<br><br><br>
“感谢你的光临，也感谢你给我们带来犹太人的介绍”赵
悠悠说。<br><br><br>
“你刚说的没错，是的，我就是为了种族的繁衍才生的孩
子。”阿尔伯特说。<br><br><br>
“那下次你带孩子们一起来”赵悠悠随口客气。<br><br><br>
“她们跟她们的妈妈在一起，我带不了”阿尔伯特努力用
筷子夹起一块鸡肉。<br><br><br>
“那你带太太和孩子一起来就好了呀” 这客气还没完了。
<br><br><br>

 “她们的妈妈不是我太太，哇，这个好吃”阿尔伯特一边
吃一边说。<br><br><br>
“那是女朋友吗?”赵悠悠硬着头皮不把天聊死。<br><br><br>
“也不是，我们是合约关系”阿尔伯特解释道，他又看上
了一块牛腩。<br><br><br>
“是代孕妈妈吗?生完还给抚养的吗?”赵悠悠吃了一口
干锅土豆，对自己的厨艺暗暗称奇。<br><br><br>
“不是，我们是生育合作伙伴。我们有两个孩子，但她不
是我的妻子。我们签了合同，一起养孩子，但从来没发生
过关系。这个牛肉也好吃”感觉这家伙是真心爱吃中餐。
“真是超前的做法”赵悠悠忍不住赞叹，用契约关系来养
孩子，对女性来说无异于福音。“你们是怎么想起来要这
么做的呢?”她继续问道。
<br><br><br>

 “她想要自己的孩子，而我也觉得是时候该繁殖了” 阿尔 伯特用了reproduction这个词。
<br><br><br>“嗯嗯，反正犹太人家里有的是矿要继承” 赵悠悠心里想。
<br><br><br>“给你们看我女儿的照片”阿尔伯特放下筷子掏出手机，
翻出他和两个小女孩的合影。一个大概五六岁，一个三四
岁，两个套娃都是乌黑浓密的头发，大大的黑眼睛周围绕
着毛刷一样的长睫毛，长得漂亮极了。<br><br><br>
“哇，好漂亮”赵悠悠由衷的赞叹，跟着说:“他们的妈
妈一定得更漂亮”<br><br><br>
“嗨，怎么说话呢?虽然我是个犹太人，但我长得可算是
好看的。”阿尔伯特立刻揪出赵悠悠话里的刻薄。赵悠悠
已经很长时间没有跟聪明人聊过天了，那种透着聪明劲
儿，完全放松的幽默，着实让人愉快。
<br><br><br>

 一顿饭宾主尽欢，知识点、幽默感、情绪价值拉满。阿尔
伯特吃完饭坚持帮忙洗碗，几个碗洗的水漫金山，一直到
九点多才收拾完毕起身告辞，赵悠悠端着剩菜，跟阿尔伯
特说笑着出门，今天的厨余比较多，院子里的两只猫吃不
完，她准备到空地里去喂一下其他的猫。<br><br><br>
刚走到空地，猫们闻到气味，开始逐渐收拢包围圈。刚把 剩饭放到地上，猫们忽然往后又退了几步。赵悠悠回头一 看，邻居斯皮罗斯端着一个大碗走过来。他在不远处停 下，嘴里发出“pspspsps”的声音召唤猫咪。猫们迟疑 了一下，仿佛互相确认似得各自喵了几声，最终决定围到 赵悠悠的剩菜边。
黑暗中看不清斯皮罗斯的表情，他把大碗放到地上，从远
处跑来参加聚会的橘猫经过他身边，停下来闻了闻斯皮罗
斯的食物，随机甩甩爪子，跟着向其他猫们跑去，边跑边
摇头，仿佛想把刚刚吸入鼻孔的气味甩掉。斯皮罗斯失落
的站在原地。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠忍着笑，转身往家里走去。奶牛猫母子远远跟着她
一路走回院子。
<br><br><br>

 “罗西塔!你去哪里?”斯皮罗斯明知故问地叫道。<br><br><br>
罗西塔?赵悠悠虽然听不懂希腊语，但能听出这是一个名
字。原来这只猫有名字?她真的是暴躁邻居的猫妈?她不
禁感到好奇。但自从斯皮罗斯拒绝她通过他们家的阳台回
自己家后，她就再也没跟他打过照面，更没有说过话。<br><br><br>
“喂，中国女人!”斯皮罗斯在背后用英语怒气冲冲地
喊。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠转过身来，盯着斯皮罗斯，一言不发。<br><br><br>
“你在偷我的猫!”斯皮罗斯说道。<br><br><br>
“你的猫?你的猫饿的每天都跑到我家讨饭吃!你为什么
不拦着她?”听到“偷”这个词，赵悠悠有些不悦，但这
种幼稚的争执让她生不起气来。
<br><br><br>

 “我给了它们足够的食物!”斯皮罗斯抗辩道。<br><br><br>
“因为我们不喜欢爸爸做的饭!所以我们每天都有好多吃 的可以喂猫”斯皮罗斯的双胞胎听到外面的争执声，从阳 台上探出头来，康斯坦丁用英语大声揭穿父亲。他们显然 对自己能参与这场谈话感到兴奋。这时成煜臣也跑到阳台 上观望，随时准备为妈妈撑腰。看起来，他已经有了盟 友，战局已经形成:4v1。
“你们给我回去!”斯皮罗斯冲着双胞胎喊道。<br><br><br>
“听着，斯皮罗斯，没人想要偷走你的猫，如果它们是你
的，为什么会像流浪猫一样每天都来我门口要吃的，你是
不是该反思一下自己到底给它们喂了什么?有没有养好它
们?”<br><br><br>
“爸爸说，猫咪们很喜欢他做的饭!但是我从来没见它们
吃过”安娜不甘寂寞地继续“背刺”。
<br><br><br>

 斯皮罗斯几个月来的怒火瞬间达到了顶点，他开始对赵悠
悠大声嚷嚷:“你才该问问自己到底喂了它什么?鬼知道
你做了什么奇怪的中国食物让猫上瘾，你们那些乱七八糟
的调料说不定还会损害健康!”<br><br><br>
“什么?你听听你在说什么!首先，我用的全是超市买的
食材。如果你做不出好吃的东西，那是你的问题，别把气
撒在别人身上，好吗?其次，你了解中国食物吗?你尝试
过中国菜吗?你的这些偏见是从哪儿来的?请不要随便对
不懂的事物下判断，这样会显得你不那么聪明。”赵悠悠
简直快要被气笑了，没听过这么蛮不讲理的言论。<br><br><br>
“当一个人大喊大叫的时候，其实是对他自己感到失
望。”成煜臣站在阳台上帮腔。有一次，妈妈开车迷路时
曾对他大喊大叫，冷静后她对他道歉说:“对不起，儿
子!当一个人大喊大叫时，实际上他是在对自己感到失
望，这是一个人无力掌控局面时的返祖表现。我刚刚就展
现了这种动物性”成煜臣不知道返祖的英语怎么说，也觉
得“动物性”这个词有些冒犯，于是选择了更温和的表
达。
<br><br><br>

 成煜臣的话让斯皮罗斯冷静了一些，他意识到自己确实有
点无理取闹。孩子说得没错，他的确是在对自己感到失
望。前妻根本不相信他能照顾好孩子，她像一个胸有成竹
的捕猎者，悠然地在西班牙，得意洋洋的俯视着他一败涂
地。她已经做好准备，等着斯皮罗斯认输并求助，并顺理
成章的把孩子们接到西班牙。<br><br><br>
“可恶的女人!”他咕哝了一句，分不清自己是在骂赵悠
悠还是前妻。他对当下的境况感到挫败，但一生要强的希
腊男人怎么可能会对这个隔壁的麻烦制造专家承认这一点
呢?他怒气冲冲地转身回屋。罗西塔用一种温柔的目光看
着他离去，喵了一声。<br><br><br>
虽然大舅是猫帮的实际头目，但罗西塔更像个帮派的精神 领袖，也像个大家族里的老母亲。她调和着猫与人类的关 系，不仅约束流浪猫的行为，也常常对鲁莽的人类投以同 情的目光。她已经很努力的假装吃这位难吃料理大师的饭 菜，奈何份量之多，味道之难吃，连她这个猫界奥斯卡影 后都实在演不下去，只好逃到隔壁。她也没料到自己的叛 逃会让斯皮罗斯如此失落...

<h3> 7.感恩节的岛</h3>
同胞圈子在海外生活里像是一个虫洞，一个结界，一个迷
你宇宙。它能让你瞬间穿越，回到熟悉的生活模式中。在
这里，大家说着同样的语言，有着一样的思维模式和意识
形态。遵循相同的社交模式和价值观。它是一个微缩的小
中国。<br><br><br>
在这个迷你小中国里，人们各自成群，要么共同做点小生 意，要么一起去买菜接送孩子，要么搭伴儿上课健身，要 么扎堆唱歌打麻将。遇到事情互相询问，帮忙牵线搭桥， 交换一下二手商品，国内国外给带个文件凭证什么的，一 是一，二是二，AA制，该付的劳务费用清清白白，一分不 少。
有时候来往多了，遇到性情相投的，慢慢也就成了朋友。
				<br><br><br>
孟夏就是这样的朋友。
				<br><br><br>
孟夏是赵悠悠在国内社交软件上认识的女生。她已经移民
到希腊六年，经常在自媒体上发布希腊生活攻略，吸引一
些在雅典拥有房产的中国客户，帮助他们运营民宿。
<br><br><br>

 两人第一次约见的时候，赵悠悠刚到希腊一个多月。两人 约在Zografos的网红酒吧Lot51见面。希腊说是经济不 好，但每天咖啡厅和酒吧都爆满，只不过一杯咖啡坐一下 午，一杯酒扛一晚上。
九月的希腊，依旧酷热。孟夏单穿了个老头背心就来了。
身材挺拔、肌肉紧实、线条分明，一身光滑的皮肤晒的闪
闪发光。平整度极高的脸，鼻梁上一堆细小雀斑，小丹凤
眼儿大厚嘴唇。背后跟着一个金发碧眼的瘦高个儿。见到
赵悠悠，立刻灿烂的冲她一笑，笑起来眼角全是细纹，一
口广告般整齐大白牙，美的让人挪不开眼睛。
				<br><br><br>
“这我炮友，丹尼尔。这位是赵女士。”
				<br><br><br>
孟夏大大方方地介绍道。丹尼尔礼貌地向赵悠悠打了个招
呼，跟着坐到一旁，打开电脑开始工作。
				<br><br><br>
“他是数字游民，跟着我来蹭网的。咱可以忽略他的存
在”
<br><br><br>

 孟夏活泼地招呼服务员点单。
				<br><br><br>
“据说雅典现在数字游民越来越多了。”赵悠悠应和了一
句。<br><br><br>
“是啊，早知道数字游民可以在希腊呆着，我就不会买那
个破房子了。不过，不买房子也不会知道原来在希腊做民
宿是个不错的选择。”孟夏点了杯卡普奇诺，给丹尼尔要
了杯水。<br><br><br>
“你都是自己在打理吗?”赵悠悠要了杯黑咖啡。<br><br><br>
“我请了两个清洁工，房屋维护、跟物业和住客的沟通这
些我自己做。在线上处理的部分都可以，但旅游期间的打
扫工作就只能靠他们了。”<br><br><br>
孟夏健谈且坦率。她跟赵悠悠分享了民宿代运营的内幕， 一般代运营公司会拿走40%~50%的收入。中国代理的分
<br><br><br>

 成比例较高，希腊代理收费名目繁多，最终到手的钱其实
差不多。虽然做民宿很累，但收益比长租房要高出两三
成。希腊法律非常保护租客，长租的风险在于，如果租客
住满半年，房子的“主权”几乎就属于他们了。租客可以
以经济困难为由拖欠租金，房东即使诉诸法庭，法官大多
也会站在租客一边。<br><br><br>
孟夏表达能力一流，逻辑清晰、数据详实。赵悠悠几乎没
有多想，就决定把自己的房子委托给她打理。和绝大多数
中国黄金签证的买家一样，赵悠悠还没有亲眼看过自己购
买的房子，就直接付款了。幸好房子与图片上的差别不
大，地段虽然不太适合居住，但很适合做民宿。<br><br><br>
一来二去，孟夏的热情坦率与赵悠悠的沉稳理智莫名地合
拍，两人从客户关系变成了朋友。毕竟，身在在异国他
乡，她们也没有太多其他的选择。孟夏看起来很独立，但
每次到赵悠悠家就会变成软骨猫，东倒西歪，啥也不干还
赖着不走。长时间一个人顶着风雨冲锋陷阵，冷不丁找到
一个背风的角落，会忽然散掉，瘫成一摊。<br><br><br>
“悠，周末给我做麻婆豆腐吃吧，我好想吃那个”孟夏扒
着厨房门框子哀求。<br><br><br>


 “周末我们要去安多斯岛过感恩节”赵悠悠在切洋葱准备
做土豆浓汤。<br><br><br>
“我也要去，你订了房间吗?”孟夏问<br><br><br>
“订了，是个别墅，你可以在客厅打地铺”其实楼上有三
个房间，赵悠悠故意逗她。<br><br><br>
“不，我跟弟弟睡，弟弟，我跟你睡好吧”孟夏三十出
头，她管赵悠悠叫姐姐，管成煜臣叫弟弟，完全不顾辈分
的混乱，反正两头都是差个十来岁。<br><br><br>
“Φύγε” 成煜臣从房间送出一句希腊语 “走开”
“悠，弟弟撵我” 孟夏说<br><br><br>
 

 “你活该” 赵悠悠都懒得搭理这俩冤家。成煜臣平时很有 礼貌，但他完全就不拿孟夏当个长辈，她确实也没个长辈 的样子。
<br><br><br>“等你成年了，看我不拿下你” 孟夏钻到成煜臣门口咬牙 切齿。
<br><br><br>“等我成年，你都老啦” 成煜臣就是孟夏的克星。
<br><br><br>安多斯岛是离雅典最近的岛屿之一，从拉菲娜港口乘轮渡
不到两个小时就能到达。希腊不愧是世界航运大国，轮渡
四通八达，方便快捷。赵悠悠发现，希腊有个特点:初入
其系统时，你会觉得管理松散，流程简陋;但当你完成整
个流程时，会发现希腊人的聪明也体现在他们完全丢弃了
花里胡哨的形式主义。<br><br><br>
她曾经在帕纳辛奈科体育馆观看过奥运圣火传递仪式。当
时体育馆门口没有任何指引，没有工作人员，无需买票，
也没人检查证件。所有人都是自发地排队入场。这个全大
理石建造的体育场，简洁而宏大。没人争抢好位置，人们
随意就座。出人意料的是，这无组织无纪律的上万人，不
到半小时就进场完毕，全都安然就座。表演人员刚从大门
口鱼贯而入，齐刷刷的掌声瞬间如雷贯耳。
				<br><br><br>
也许这就是希腊的风格吧!你看不见秩序，而它存在于老
百姓日常的行为一致性中。也许，那些像斯皮罗斯一样致
力于维护规则的人，就是保障生活有序进行的“看不见的
大手”。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠把车开进轮渡时也是如此，你只需要跟随车流，按
指挥行动。每个人都不争不抢，调度员永远力求公平。车
子一辆接一辆的开进轮渡的“肚子”里，按调度员的指引
一辆挨一辆地排得整整齐齐。下船时同样井然有序。不到
十五分钟，所有汽车便安然驶入岛上。<br><br><br>
“这个岛让我想起宫崎骏的电影。”赵悠悠开着车，沿着
蜿蜒曲折的海边小路前行时感叹道。<br><br><br>
“对对对，是不是《风之谷》?”孟夏附和说。<br><br><br>
“安多斯岛就是以大风著名的。”后座的成煜臣补充道。
<br><br><br>

 他们预订的民宿位于半山腰，是一座简朴的石头房子。荒
芜的山坡上，狂风呼啸，面对大海，安静而孤独。<br><br><br>
“加纳利群岛和安多斯岛是不是在同一纬度?”孟夏问。<br><br><br>
“这里的环境确实会让人想起三毛的家。”赵悠悠回应<br><br><br>
道。孟夏虽然比她小十来岁，但两人的阅读和观影背景却
有很多重叠之处，这或许也是她们能合拍的原因。<br><br><br>
话音未落，台阶下有人喊了一声: “哈喽?有人吗?”<br><br><br>
赵悠悠和孟夏探出头去，看到两个年轻男孩站在院门口。<br><br><br>
“有什么可以帮忙的吗?”赵悠悠有点警觉，这里前不着
村后不着店，来路不明的人总让人有些紧张。
<br><br><br>

 “我们的民宿没有熨斗，能借一下你们的熨斗吗?我很快
就会还回来。”其中一个男孩指了指两点钟方向，果然，
离他们两百米远的地方还站着一栋石头房子。房子就地取
材，石头墙面的颜色完全融入到周围环境中去，不仔细
看，还真发现不了。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠和孟夏对视了一眼，赵悠悠转身上楼去拿熨斗。
两个男生借到熨斗离开后，孟夏挤了挤眼睛，笑道:
“哎，挺帅的哈。”<br><br><br>
“在我看来都是小孩子。”赵悠悠说，孩子像是人年龄的
分界线，当你没有孩子，似乎就可以永远做一个孩子。
“他俩问我们晚上要不要一起去酒吧喝酒。”<br><br><br>
“哈哈，我已经有孩子要陪了。”赵悠悠望了望成煜臣的
房间。<br><br><br>

 移居海外有许多弊端。你是少数派，是异乡人，难免被用
异样的目光看待。但同时，这也是一种优势。你是稀缺
的，是带着异国风情充满魅力的。从不同的角度看，结论
也不一样。<br><br><br>
“你想去就去吧，注意安全。”赵悠悠看出孟夏的企图。
直到丹尼尔敲门，吵醒赵悠悠和成煜臣时，赵悠悠才意识
到，孟夏昨晚并没有回来。<br><br><br>
				
如果你想快速掌握一门外语，轻松融入本地生活，深入了
解一个国家的文化，那就找一个当地的恋人作为向导吧。
赵悠悠生平看的第一场的歌剧是《蝴蝶夫人》。关于旅居
海外，找个本地情人的故事，前有《风中奇缘》，后有
《最后的武士》，而杰西卡·阿尔巴的电影《字典情人》
则是对这种关系的功能性表达的最直白的。不论电影多么
浪漫唯美，以爱为终章，都逃不出最初的利用目的。而几
乎所有类似的电影中，充当“字典情人”的角色都是女
性，她们温柔忠贞，在这一不对等的恋爱关系里充当着牺
牲者的角色，简直就是二等公民。<br><br><br>尽管自己此刻扮演的是
那个远行者的角色，但赵悠悠却还是会不自觉的地会把视
角放到那个被动的本地姑娘的身上。<br><br><br>
孟夏就完全不同。她身上有高度自我价值认可，代际差异
并不简单的按年龄来划分，有一种是以自我角色认知为界
线。孟夏具备女性的丰富情感，细腻、敏锐、富有弹性和
韧性，但几乎没有受害者的意识，很少进行自我反省和修
正，更别提什么自我牺牲了。<br><br><br>
“简直就是去芜存菁。”赵悠悠曾由衷地赞美她这种特
质。<br><br><br>
孟夏从来不劝赵悠悠找男朋友。她自己频繁约会，对两性
关系保持一种纯粹的动物性态度。她并不排斥情感的纠
缠，但更奉行人道主义友好共生，并不想把它变成复杂深
刻的恋人关系。<br><br><br>
“可能是还没到那个年纪吧?还没拿到繁衍和养育后代的
任务卡，所以没有活得那么复杂。”孟夏会这样自我解
释。尽管她已经三十出头了，但在她的自我认知里还属于
今朝有酒今朝醉的年轻人。<br><br><br>


 丹尼尔坐在厨房，和成煜臣并肩吃着赵悠悠给他们做的早
餐。他显得有些尴尬，虽然赵悠悠没提孟夏的行踪，但他
心里很清楚。毕竟，他们也不是第一天认识。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠端起自己的咖啡，跟丹尼尔说:“我去院子里晒晒
太阳，你慢慢吃，别拿自己当外人。”<br><br><br>
丹尼尔这个北欧大男孩，乍看之下又高又帅，像个花花公
子。可接触下来会发现，他其实是个规规矩矩的好孩子。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠不愿看着他那么煎熬，但又怕自己说漏什么给孟夏
带来麻烦，于是干脆避而不谈。成煜臣吃完回房看书，留
下丹尼尔一个人坐在宽大的客厅里冲着落地窗发呆。<br><br><br>
希腊的天气晴朗少雨，大部分民宿采用简洁明快的地中海
式建筑风格。因为气候干燥，打扫勤勉，房前屋后看不到
霉斑或青苔之类的东西。希腊人盖房子崇尚自然美感，倾
向于使用天然的石材和素雅的墙漆。<br><br><br>在这里，你几乎看不
到现代城市硬朗的钢筋水泥和冰冷的玻璃幕墙组成的建
筑，它也没有巴塞罗那或佛罗伦萨那些肃杀的哥特式或华
丽的巴洛克风格建筑。乍一看，可能杂乱无章，甚至带着乡土气息。但当你真正搬进这些被绿植环绕、阳光透达，
干燥温暖的居所里时，会感到无比的放松。它们是真正用
来居住、生活的。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠曾经和一个希腊人讨论过这个观察，她说:
“也许是因为这种建筑风格更接近自然，而人本能地会对
自然产生亲近和放松的感觉。毕竟，人类就是从自然中来
的啊”<br><br><br>
那位希腊人大笑道:
“照你这么说，我们干脆搬到洞穴里住算了，岂不是更接
近自然?”<br><br><br>
“别说，说不定住在洞穴里真的更舒适，更有安全感
呢。”赵悠悠打趣道。
<br><br><br>

 推开厨房的木框玻璃门，外面是一个小院子，院里有烧烤
架和遮阳伞。台阶下方有一个不大的泳池，池边放了两把
躺椅和一只打捞落水树叶和飞虫的网子，除此之外没有多
余的东西。然而，这种简朴恰到好处。赵悠悠在希腊时常
会有“这就够了”的感觉。<br><br><br>出入平安，自由自在，三餐健
康丰盛，四季庭院如画，其他的东西有还是没有，好像也
没有多大区别。<br><br><br>
她认识的每一个希腊人，一提到“周末计划”，不是去山
上徒步就是去沙滩晒太阳。希腊拥有全欧洲最长的海岸线
和最多的日照时长，南欧人普遍认为享受生活乃世间第一
奥义，使得他们丝毫不愿浪费这天赐的资源。和北欧人注
重精致的生活方式相比，希腊人更专注于没有负担的放松
和亲近自然，并不怎么在意这种享受看起来是否高雅或上
档次。<br><br><br>
“你要是还嫌不够，觉得无聊，这不是还有各种各样不省
事的朋友给你的生活加点料吗。”赵悠悠看见孟夏晃晃悠
悠从远处那座石头屋子走出来心想，她起身迎了过去。
“昨儿喝大了。”孟夏举手遮住阳光，冲她喊道。
<br><br><br>

 “丹尼尔来了。”赵悠悠笑着对她说。<br><br><br>
“早叫他来的时候，他推三阻四的。”孟夏把赵悠悠手里
的咖啡拿过去一饮而尽，溜达着进了屋。不一会儿成煜臣
识相地从屋里出来，坐到泳池边开始打游戏。屋里传来激
烈的争吵声，孟夏的嗓门和语速都达到了前所未有的高
度。<br><br><br>
“我说外语口条最利索的时候就是吵架的时候。真气急
了，希腊语也能吵起来。总共就会不到一百个希腊句子，
也能吵个半小时不带停的。”<br><br><br>
这是孟夏对自己语言能力的总结。她在国外上的大学，英
语原本就很溜。但每次一上火就更是口若悬河。平时犄角
旮旯里藏着的词汇和短语会被肾上腺素激活，得见天日。
此外情急之下还会动用自己的中文储备，实现跨文化羞
辱。即便对方听不懂:对牛弹琴、小肚鸡肠、井底之蛙、
鼠目寸光等等中国古典骂人集锦，但从里面包含的各种动
物以及孟夏的鄙夷且愤怒的声音里可以知道，她是在侮辱
自己，且侮辱的很严重。
<br><br><br>

 两人吵了能有一个小时，最终开开心心地上楼做爱去了。
双方的分歧点在于，彼此究竟是不是对方的恋人，还能不
能跟其他异性约会乃至发生关系。<br><br><br>正方意见是:当你跟一
个人在发生关系的期间，就算没有明确的承诺，那也相当
于在一段关系里。就不能随便跟其他异性发生关系。<br><br><br>反方
的意见是:我们有确定过关系吗?谁给性关系这么大的约
束权力的啊?你怕不是从清朝穿越过来的吧?<br><br><br>正反方在对
清朝所处的时间段以及彼时的中西方的两性道德标准进行
了一番学术探讨未果之后，达成的统一意见是:是的，我
还是喜欢跟你睡觉的。其他的事情，哎呀，再说吧。<br><br><br>
天气好的地方，脱衣服就容易。有什么问题，赤裸相见，
深入交流一番，也就没力气再争辩了。所以南欧人普遍比
北欧人热情快活。丹尼尔这个北欧冰雕，在希腊也快融化
的七七八八了。<br><br><br>
情绪和肉体的激烈碰撞，让楼上楼下飘散着荷尔蒙的气
息。赵悠悠眺望远处湛蓝的大海，脑海中浮现起曾有人对
她的劝说:
 “你一个单身，为什么要压抑自己?就不能好好享受一下
性爱?身心全然的张开会让你充满能量，变得年轻”<br><br><br>
也许孟夏如此有生命力，就来自于她全然张开的大腿，哈
哈。赵悠悠对自己的想法笑了起来，不对不对，是全然张
开的性格。<br><br><br>她忽然意识到，当她对张开的大腿感到好笑的
时候，是一种轻快愉悦的想法，不带任何批判的观点。是
啊，这么灿烂的阳光下，彼此拥有这么美好的身体，不用
来做爱，难道用来做恨吗?<br><br><br>
成煜臣从泳池边跑回院子，太阳逐渐升高，他已经无法再
躲在墙的阴影下。他似乎又长高了，人也沉稳懂事了不
少。不过，孩子毕竟还是孩子，不论赵悠悠在忙些什么，
他依然每隔一会儿就会跑到她身边，尝试揉乱她的头发或
者挠她的痒痒，像是用这种方式在确认自己和母亲之间的
连接。儿时的大部分顽皮行为已经渐渐消停，但仍有一小
部分保留了下来。<br><br><br>
孩子就像一棵小树，而母亲就是孕育他的那颗种子。在生
命的初期，小树是从种子里汲取营养的，慢慢的，小树长
出自己的根与枝叶，开始从土壤和阳光中吸取更多的水分
和养分。当他根深叶茂，能够独立生存的时候，种子也就
完成了自己的使命，献出自己所有的营养，最后只剩下一
个空壳。这或许就是当今年轻人不愿结婚生子的一个原
因:没有人愿意仅仅成为一粒种子，最终化为一无所有的
空壳。<br><br><br>
赵悠悠默默地望着他，脑中闪过一个念头——要不然，找 一个希腊人约会吧?和一个希腊男人在一起，学一学希腊 语，了解怎么挑奶酪，还有人帮忙修理下水管道，在生活 中了解这个国家的文化和老百姓的生活。这才是真正的 “去体验不一样的生活啊!” 更别提，希腊男人大多身材 健美，容貌英俊...
她的目光再次转向远处的地中海，海风轻轻拂过她的面
颊，她在心里再次确认:
“哎哟，这个想法不错哦!”

                <h3>A Cross-Cultural Contemporary Women's Novel</h3><h3> by Zhang Yun</h3> 
<br>
Some chapter summaries, this book will be published by World Chinese Press in March 2025
<br>
The following are translated by DeepSeek <br> <br>
              <h3>Preface</h3>
The world needs to flow, otherwise prejudice and estrangement will grow stronger. People who travel the world are the capillaries of cultural exchange. They use their bodies to connect with other civilizations, eliminate opposition, and protect peace.


Growth and exploration are human instincts, just like eating, drinking, defecating, and reproducing, they are basic desires. They are also the cause of adolescence and midlife crises.


The basis of long-term relationships between people is labor exchange, from countries to families, it is nothing more than learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses and cooperating with each other.


The story is like Pinocchio, made in the shape of a human, you think it is a puppet, but as soon as it has eyebrows and eyes, it has independent will. The development of the plot, the words said and the decisions made are natural and cannot be controlled at all.


This is a story. If there are similarities, there is no need to match them.


1. Strange Woman
Athens is windy and dry in the summer, and the sky cannot hold clouds. Occasionally, some water vapor evaporates to the sky and becomes a lonely cloud. You can watch it disappear bit by bit, just like writing calligraphy with water.


There are no trees on the mountains. At most, there are some maquis bushes growing here and there. For example, olive trees. Olive trees grow quite poetically, with densely packed heads of fine gray leaves, just like the trees in "Oliver's Landscape Sketches". There are also various grasses with small purple flowers, rosemary, thyme and sage, all of which are the ingredients sung in the song "Scarborough Fair".


Chinese cheongsams are embroidered with plum, orchid, bamboo and chrysanthemum, and Greek dresses are painted with small flowers and grapevines. Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, whatever grows on their own land is beautiful, and the earth is the god of beauty in the world.


The highway in Athens can best create a lonely and romantic feeling. There are few cars, and the road is built without taking shortcuts, but along the scenery. In the vast wilderness, people can obviously take a straight road, but they insist on going around. When they come to a nice place, they will suddenly open up a piece of open space, paved with gravel, and leave it for passing cars to stop and admire. The beauty is that not many people have time to stop there to enjoy the scenery, but they still have to leave it.


Greeks are half leisurely and idle, and half anxious and time-saving models. They can chat with the cashier until the end of time when buying a scallion in the supermarket, but they can't wait even a second when starting the car, and they are determined to grab the lost time. Greeks self-deprecatingly say that they are more hardworking than Germans in December because they have to finish all the work they have accumulated in a year in one go.


Zhao Youyou has no time to appreciate the scenery along the way. She is staring at her mobile phone navigation to make sure she is not in the wrong lane. The map's instructions are confusing. What does "stay in the left lane and turn right slightly" mean?


The network in Greece is not satisfactory, and the voice is often delayed. If you drive slowly, you are afraid of delaying the drivers behind you to rush for time. He could only step on the accelerator while staring at the map. So the car gradually deviated at a tiny angle, with a difference of a millimeter, and a thousand miles away from the road.


When Zhao Youyou suddenly pulled back his sight and glanced at the road, he found that he was riding on the lane dividing line. In panic, he subconsciously slammed the steering wheel to correct the error. The SUV behind him was frightened and screamed.


First, a short horn sounded to express fear, and then the horn was pressed hard to simulate a loud curse. Even so, the driver was still not satisfied, and accelerated to Zhao Youyou's side, opened the window and prepared to scold face to face. Unexpectedly, the window of the car that caused the accident was blocked by black gauze, and it was pitch black and nothing could be seen. The indignant victim had no choice but to press the horn for a long time. The sound was gentle and long, and the lingering sound was not only angry, but also carried righteous moral condemnation.


Athens has a permanent population of less than four million, and its population, area and GDP are roughly the same as those of Chaoyang District in Beijing. Most of the citizens live in the city center, within a radius of 40 square kilometers. The tallest building has 25 floors. Trash cans are placed on the road, and cables are hung on poles and drag through the streets. The cement road is bumpy and bumpy, and it proudly refuses all high heels. The curbs are overgrown with weeds, dotted with pine cones or oranges that have fallen from the trees. Pigeons walk around the oranges, which are bitter and they don't like to eat. Takeout is either pizza or pita bread, ice cream and snacks are too sweet, and the Yiwu small commodities in the window are from ten years ago. There are three subway lines, and places that are too far away cannot be reached. You can only drive, and if you drive badly, you will be honked all the way.


Speaking of why she came here? Zhao Youyou has several versions. At first, she would say that Greece is the birthplace of Western civilization. If you want to understand European culture and experience a different life, it would be a great place to start. Later, she got tired of it and said that it was for the children's education, and it would be cheaper if they didn't roll. This answer is easy to understand and easy to accept. In fact, there is a more real and simple answer: this is a foreign land.


It is enough to be far enough, let people come, and stay. Eight thousand kilometers, golden visa, Mediterranean climate and food. Greece has all three. Through the greatest physical distance, the greatest degree of separation can be achieved. As for why we do this, it started with a sofa.


The car drove to the Attiki Odos toll station. The yellow one is the automatic payment channel E-pass, and there is a little man on the blue channel with a hand stretched out. Zhao Youyou was buried in the map and accidentally entered the automatic toll lane. When she found that she was in the wrong lane, the cars behind her were lined up in a long line. She reversed with a shameless face and turned to the manual channel. She backed up carefully without looking sideways. She knew without looking that the drivers behind her must be livid and cursing. Greeks are not suitable to be drivers. They get angry when driving, and they are not like this at other times. The toll collector of the blue channel greeted Zhao Youyou's outstretched arm enthusiastically. He couldn't see her because she was blocked by the gauze. The toll collector took the 2.5 euros in Zhao Youyou's hand. As soon as the gate was lifted, the car ran away. The toll collector held up the receipt and muttered: "έχει καεί (burned out. It means: there is something wrong)" "What?" The driver of the SUV behind handed over the change and said casually. This is a Range Rover. Athens is a thousand-year-old city with ups and downs. The roads are difficult and narrow, and the roadside is full of cars. If you don't want to add to your troubles, the smaller the car,


the more convenient it is. There are many real warriors who dare to face the bleak life and must drive a big car to pursue breadth in the narrowness. "Mysterious person, I wonder if it is a gangster or a terrorist?" The toll collector was very satisfied with his humor and answered with a smile. The Land Rover driver took a look at the "gangster car" that disappeared in front of him. Isn't this black Mini Cooper the one that just hit him? There is an old Chinese saying: No enemies, no gathering. There is a Greek proverb: Ο διάβολος έχει πολλά ποδά ρια. It means that the devil has many legs. If it intends to bother you, it will always find you. Spiros thought that this was a parting, but it was just the beginning.


He just got off work and rushed to pick up the children from school. He had to take ten minutes to go to the supermarket to buy some food. Grilled meat? Meatballs? Or cheese and spinach pancakes? Cheese and spinach pancakes are delicious and convenient, and are Spiros' favorite. But the children's mother explicitly forbade him to feed the children ready-made supermarket food. Grilled meat and meatballs had been eaten a few days ago. The children voted unanimously that they would never eat them again.


The agreement Julia reached with him before going to Spain was: eat healthy and keep stable grades. She knew she would win without a doubt. Whether in the previous marriage or in the years after the divorce, when has she ever lost? Except this time, he would not agree to the children going back to Spain with her, so he took the children to his side and fought for almost half a year. The car turned into the supermarket parking lot, and Spiros still hadn't figured out what to cook for the children in the evening.


After leaving the highway, Zhao Youyou was once again caught in her own road problem: Where am I?


The buildings everywhere are exactly the same, seven-story residential buildings, beige exterior walls, all balconies are wide and large, and all have awnings. The road is full of cars on both sides, and each car is obedient: tighten the rearview mirror, and the wheels are attached to the curb. The road left in the middle is still less than two meters.


Every step forward feels like there is no way back. Zhao Youyou recalled the experience of climbing Chuanshanyan in Guilin 20 years ago. Chuanshanyan is a flat cave that connects the front and the back, just enough for a person to crawl through. Climbing forward from the entrance, the cave will become narrower and narrower, and the final exit is so narrow that the tour guide needs to pull it out.


At this moment, Zhao Youyou felt like she was squeezed in a rock formation, and could get stuck somewhere at any time, unable to move. A blue electric delivery car was following behind, desperately following Zhao Youyou's car. Zhao Youyou saw the Indian guy following


closely in the rearview mirror, but she was helpless. The car radar kept calling out, either "Ouch, the left side is scratched" or "No, the right side is about to hit", and she couldn't go any faster.


A bearded man with a cigarette in his mouth pushed open the roadside gate with brisk steps and came out. Seeing Zhao Youyou moving like a slow-motion video, he immediately stopped and began to give instructions. The Greeks are very good at teaching others how to drive. Left, right, forward and backward, they give you clear instructions. With the help of the midwife, Zhao Youyou's delivery-style driving was much smoother. She soon slid out of the birth canal and gave birth successfully. Both mother and child were safe. The bearded man finished his instructions and left without leaving any credit or fame.


The map navigation patiently waited for Zhao Youyou to drive out, and continued to prompt with good temper: "Drive forward 200 meters and turn around at the stop sign." Zhao Youyou stepped on the accelerator and only turned half of the car body. The rear end of the car was still on the side of the isolation belt, and was blocked by the car parked on the side of the road. She was about to turn back and back a few meters. Unexpectedly, a Land Rover came straight at her from behind, blocking the retreat. It's a pity that the narrow alley just now didn't have a difficult delivery, but it was blocked on the main road. Zhao Youyou honked the horn and signaled the Land Rover to back up a little. Land Rover opened the window and sent out a series of dragon roars. Zhao Youyou, who didn't know what was going on, unbuckled her seat belt and got out of the car with full insensitivity to negotiate.


Zhao Youyou didn't have a driver's license. Because in Greece, foreign tax numbers are not allowed to take a driver's license test. I don't know what the logic is. "I tell you, Greece has no logic," the guy selling car insurance said while filling out the form for her. "Just wait, this rule will be invalidated sooner or later."


The reason is not difficult to understand. This rule has caused a lot of people without driver's licenses to shuttle through the streets and alleys every day. It's not that they don't want to take a driver's license test, but you don't let them take the test, which is obviously inappropriate. When more and more complaints accumulate, government officials want to solve this problem, but they don't trace back to why foreign tax numbers can't take a driver's license test in the first place. So with a stroke of the pen, this stumbling block was removed. As for whether it will leave a pit after the removal, no one knows. Let's talk about it when there is a problem. The Greeks have many troubles and many ways, and they don't like to settle accounts after the autumn. The solution does not require long-termism.


Without a driver's license, she inevitably felt guilty, and she would suffer from imposter syndrome when she sat in the driver's seat. Whenever other drivers honked their horns and passed her angrily, she would immediately decide that she had made a huge mistake and had to correct it immediately. But it was different when she got out of the car. It was illegal for Ms. Zhao Youyou to sit in the driver's seat, but as a legal resident holding a golden visa, it was reasonable and legal for her to stand on the land of Greece.


"Can you speak English? I need a U-turn!" she said to the Land Rover driver. Spyros pushed his sunglasses to his forehead, staring at the slender Asian woman and the familiar black mini in front of him, and remembered the toll collector's accusation: "I don't know if she is a gangster or a terrorist." The woman had long hair and a pale face compared to the local Greeks, as if she would disappear if she wiped her face. She wore a loose shirt and wide-leg pants, which flattened against her body when the wind blew, as if she was about to fly away. She is a gangster.


"GPS says that I can turn around here." More and more cars are waiting to turn left behind Spiros' car, and some of them are honking their horns impatiently. Spiros said nothing, shifted gears and reversed with a dark face. Zhao Youyou hurried back to the car and turned around and left in a hurry.


When you are far enough away from the familiar environment, every insignificant thing, even if it is as small as a needle, can make you exhausted. For example, you are so nervous on an unfamiliar road that even turning around cannot avoid a quarrel and a contest.


Speaking of which, there is indeed a problem related to needles. I don't know where to buy needles in Athens. Zhao Youyou plans to sew the curtains in the room together, otherwise there will always be a gap and it can't be blocked tightly. She recently had a pair of golden brown corduroy pants that were torn, but she couldn't bear to throw them away. She still folded them and put them on the top of the closet, in case she needed to use the cloth zipper or something one day. When I was young, I also wore a golden brown corduroy vest. After just a few days of wearing it, a hole was hooked in the wire mesh. My mother asked Zhao Youyou to choose a pattern from the book and embroider it on the hole for her. Zhao Youyou didn't want to copy the book, so she drew a pattern herself. While embroidering, her mother asked: What is this? Zhao Youyou said: It's the bitter melon and its whiskers. In Greece, I always have trouble with needles and threads. The smaller it is, the more difficult it is to start. It seems that I have returned to the era of material scarcity.


All the way forward, the dense vehicles were swallowed up by the road home, becoming more and more sparse, and the road became thinner and thinner. Finally, I turned into the ultimate capillary road, Lianis, and I was home. This area is called Glikani, 14 kilometers away from the city center. It is a relatively new community. Many houses are half-repaired and thrown on the roadside, and some are picked up and rebuilt. Each plot of land is about 200 to 300 square meters, with three floors built on it, and seven or eight families live in it. In China, this is called a garden house. The difference is that each house looks different, and the living and management methods are also different. For example, some use oil for heating, some use gas, or simply use fireplaces to burn firewood. Before October, the balconies start to pile up piles of thick wood piles.


This is the first time Zhao Youyou drove here by herself. She circled the building twice before finding an empty parking space. There is a garage downstairs, but the garage space is limited, and it is inconvenient to get in and out. Everyone finds it troublesome and usually parks on the roadside. The street lights are dim and the space is narrow. Zhao Youyou carefully pulled over and tried to keep the car close to the curb. She got out of the car to check the parking effect and was quite satisfied with her parking skills.


The yards on the front and back belong to three families on the second floor. When you open the gate, you can see a stone fountain sink in the middle of the neighbor's yard. The lawn is neatly trimmed. There is a giant lantana in the corner, and the pink and yellow flowers climb over the wall and hang on the roadside. Zhao Youyou's yard was sparsely covered with weeds, and the yellow mud was exposed. The lemon and orange trees were lush and full of green fruits. Cheng Yuchen came in with a suitcase, and a cat jumped out of the bushes, quickly passed them and ran out of the door.


"We're home. This time we're settling down for a long time," Zhao Youyou said as she took the suitcase from her son. There were more than a dozen steps at the gate, and it was really hard physical labor to carry several boxes up there. In the past few months, I have been moving around in various homestays. When I encountered a building without an elevator, I couldn't move anything, so I had to unpack the boxes on the spot and divide and conquer. I squatted in the lobby of the building to unpack them, and took out half of the clothes, shoes, tea sets and books, and asked my son to watch over them. I moved them up and then carried down the empty boxes to pack the rest. I became stronger from moving things around.


When I pushed open the door, I could faintly smell the aroma of baking in the hallway. There was a property notice board on the back of the door, with a form printed with the management fee for each resident, and a notice in Greek, which was probably an elevator maintenance or power outage announcement. After passing the marble stairs, the new home was in front.


As soon as I entered the door, my son immediately fell on the sofa. Although he said, "Is there anything else I can help with, Mom?" But he got up early in the morning with his mother to clean up and pack, and was busy until dark. He was so tired from head to toe that he didn't want to do anything. Zhao Youyou patted his son's face: "You have exceeded the task, lie down and have a good rest." "Really, Mom? I don't think I did anything." Cheng Yuchen showed his eyes from behind the pillow and said to his mother.


"Look, you've been assembling furniture, repairing lamps and showers, packing, taking out the trash, going to school, and doing homework these days. Your glorious achievements are simply too numerous to list. Just lie down and I'll go fry steak for you."


"Too numerous means you've done a lot of bad things, my dear mother," Cheng Yuchen complained, but he lay flat on the sofa with satisfaction.


"If you don't like it, you can change it to a book full of books." Zhao Youyou touched his son's forehead and turned on the lamp in front of the sofa before getting up. The living room was filled with soft, dim light. The room was simply furnished with light colors. Except for the fireplace in the corner with a slightly Greek style, the rest was not much different from Zhao Youyou's home eight thousand miles away.


Three meals a day, going to school, and returning home, life across thousands of mountains and rivers is not fundamentally different from before. If you have to find differences, it is nothing more than daily inconveniences: lack of goods, lack of services, and difficulty finding suitable repairmen and barbers. Dealing with these trivial difficulties will make people feel awkward and clumsy, adapting to Greek English, accepting new rules of conduct, and being whipped by life every day, as if returning to the ignorant and awe-filled childhood.


The experience, achievements and protection mechanisms accumulated over the past forty years have been abandoned the moment the plane takes off. The past social identity no longer exists, what job you do, what achievements you have made, how much wealth you have, and how many excellent people you have been around are all invalid. You are just your flesh and blood.


In the kitchen next door, Spyros was sponging and scrubbing the burnt chicken juices on the baking tray, but in vain. Just throw it back into the oven and finish it. Anna and Constantine were video chatting with their mother, talking about the good and bad things in school. They usually


spoke in Spanish, and switched to Greek when they emphasized their father's shortcomings so that Spyros could hear more clearly. Anna complained about the burnt chicken, and Constantine asked if they could order KFC to make up for it. Julia didn't have to do it herself. The importance of the child returning to his mother was self-evident.


This trick was common to Spyros, and he didn't intend to respond. From the moment he agreed to the divorce, he was determined to stop these fruitless tugs. He thought the divorce was an end, but in Julia's eyes it just opened a new battlefield. She was really an indomitable fighter. Spyros walked to the balcony, trying to block the attacks hidden in the daily greetings.


The evening breeze was cool, and the ripe figs exuded a rich and sweet fragrance. Under the street light, he saw a car parked at the door of his garage. Because the car was large, he specially separated the backyard as a garage. If it was just a temporary parking, it wouldn't matter if the owner drove away soon. However, the car looked somewhat familiar. Spiros walked down the balcony stairs and came to the yard. He took a closer look. It was a black Mini Cooper with black nets covering the windows. This car had veered past him on the highway, blocked him when turning at the intersection, and now it was haunting him again!


Could that woman really be a terrorist from abroad? Was she following him? This absurd idea was quickly dispelled by him.


In recent years, it is an indisputable fact that there are more and more foreigners of all kinds in Athens. Refugees, tourists, digital nomads, golden visa holders, they are different from traditional holiday crowds, the composition of new immigrants is complex, and their temperaments are fierce, ignorant and even reckless.


As early as ten years ago, there were no homeless people on the streets, but now in Athens, you can often see homeless people lying in a pile of dirty bedding on the roadside. A street near Constitution Square is completely occupied by drug addicts, and there are always people in a trance who inject heroin on the street without paying attention to others.


Spiros is not a conservative and xenophobic person, but this irresistible force is eroding his familiar environment. As a passionate Mediterranean city with tourism as its economic support, Athenians are generally tolerant, flexible, helpful and hospitable due to their open and willing attitude to accept new things. Spiros is no exception, but he is still occasionally irritated by the immigrants' unruliness.


If the refugees' rudeness may be caused by objective reasons such as poverty and poor education, it is understandable. Then what else could be the reason for this Asian woman who speaks fluent English, dresses decently, has a car and a house, repeatedly trampling on existing rules and aggressively invading, except for contempt and disrespect for the owner? Spiros remembered the face of the woman who came out of the car with a sense of superiority and bossy, and he could no longer bear it, so he finally picked up his phone and called the traffic police.


2. Crime: Offender



Zhao Youyou got up early in the morning before the alarm went off. There is a five-hour time difference between Greece and China. After coming to Greece for several months, I still wake up much earlier than before. This is a good thing. If anyone really can't change the habit of staying up late, they can move to a place with a time difference and try.


After August, the sun in Athens became very considerate, with a constant temperature and excellent brightness. Where there is sun, it is warm, and everything illuminated has bright colors. The sun is golden from morning to night, unlike some places, where the sun is blazing at noon and weak and pale in the morning and evening.


All the trivial clothes have been put in their proper places. I cleaned the glass window in the middle of the night, but I didn't see it clearly at the time. After it dried, there were large pieces of water stains left. The water quality in Athens is very hard. After washing, my hair fell all over the floor, and half of the man was bald.


The cars and dogs in the early morning sounded even farther away. There was no one around, so I just sat on the balcony drinking coffee and watched the sun move slowly to the table. Before the divorce, she spent countless mornings like this alone, sitting on the balcony and watching the sky light up, her heart full of resistance to everything she was about to face. Her husband and children were about to wake up, her high heels were about to be put on, the company gate was about to be walked into, and the faces in the hundreds of booths. In fact, she didn't hate being in it, but as a concept in her mind,


their existence made her feel helpless, like being in prison. They pushed her to the next task, whether she was willing or not.


She didn't know where the breath she had been holding when she was young had gone. At this time, she was like a carriage without a locomotive, relying on the original inertia and the responsibility on her shoulders to move forward, reluctantly, stumbling, and drifting with the flow.


It all started with that sofa. The top-layer cowhide corner sofa is soft and wide, and even your calves have to straighten when you sit in it. It occupies an entire wall of the living room with majesty and majesty. It is a magnificent single product. The salesperson at the furniture store said, don't look at it as expensive, it can be a family heirloom, and the leather will become more beautiful as you use it. Her husband Cheng Dongliang fell in love with it at first sight and had to buy it. Then buy it. He has never had any idea about family building, so this rare insistence must be satisfied.


She also liked this sofa at that time. It is beautiful and easy to take care of. When guests come, they will inevitably ask where it was bought? What kind of leather? It is very comfortable to sit on. The sofa is filled with goose feathers. Sitting on it feels like sitting in the clouds. How can you sit for a long time? It tilts when you sit on it, and then you lie down. A family of three, one horizontal and two vertical, lying in the clouds.


"This sofa will eat people," Zhao Youyou said to Cheng Dongliang who was lying on the chaise longue. "You don't want to get up because it's so comfortable, right? Don't you see who picked it?" Cheng Dongliang held the TV remote control to change the channel.


"My cervical vertebra hurts when I lie down," Zhao Youyou said, touching the back of his neck.


"Get a pillow to cushion it," Cheng Dongliang pulled out the pillow beside him and threw it to her. "I suddenly think that my parents' solid wood sofa is good. You can only sit upright, so there is no chance of cervical vertebra pain."


"You lack exercise. Come with me and run a marathon. All your problems will be cured." Cheng Dongliang has been running a marathon recently. Zhao Youyou's colleague and a bunch of old classmates are also running. All Chinese people are running marathons.


"No, thank you." Zhao Youyou doesn't hate running, but it's too fashionable, so fashionable that it's annoying. Cheng Dongliang knows her. Whenever everyone does something, she has to be stubborn. He didn't say anything and turned back to watch his own game.


This sofa is so annoying, but I can't help but sit on it. If I sit on it, I will fall down, and if I fall down, my neck will hurt. It goes on and on.


The alarm clock rang, and Zhao Youyou's coffee was almost gone. She went back to the kitchen to prepare breakfast and lunch. Coat the instant noodles with hot spring eggs, pour steamed fish soy sauce and vinegar, add some sesame oil, sprinkle with minced meat and seaweed, and it will be Ge Zhixuan's secret mixed noodles. Lunch is tomato, shrimp and butter mixed with broccoli, grab a handful of seaweed and beat an egg to make a lotus fresh vegetable soup. The supermarket only has those few kinds of vegetables, so I arranged them back and forth and made do with what I had. It was done in fifteen minutes.


Governing a big country is like cooking a small dish. A department with hundreds of people can handle it. A few small dishes are nothing more than formulaic operations and control of details. Eat more and analyze more. No matter how difficult the dishes are, they cannot withstand split research. At worst, there are food bloggers to back them up. Zhao Youyou does the same thing every time she gets a project. She sorts out the business framework, talks with the relevant business parties separately, and looks at the key reports in comparison. Find the data points, and then dig up the data one by one. Data is the root. Once it takes root, it is difficult to shake. Data will not lie. Data has its own logic and data can tell stories.


After eating and cleaning up, I went out with my son, chatting and laughing. In the morning light, the air in the suburbs is so fresh. Before I even got to the front of the car, I felt that something was wrong.


The license plate is gone!


Did it fall off somewhere? Zhao Youyou thought, and turned to the front of the car to see that the place where the license plate was hung on the front of the car was bare, with several screw holes exposed. Living here every day, every day! You will encounter all kinds of surprises (scares) unexpectedly. In comparison, this time ranks in the top ten of the scares list.


Was the license plate stolen? What's the use of stealing it? To use it as a license plate? Fortunately, the car looks fine, but the license plate is gone, but can I drive it today without a license plate? How will the child go to school?


The thoughts in Zhao Youyou's mind rolled like African buffaloes running wildly. What a thing like a sofa that is too soft, how insignificant, why should I complain about it, come here from afar, and face these inexplicable trivialities endlessly?


The hateful thing is that all the beatings in life are self-inflicted, who can I blame? What's more hateful is that if Cheng Dongliang knew about this, he would definitely laugh at it with disdain, some people just don't want to suffer. He didn't understand why Zhao Youyou went hiking in the wilderness and camped outside for days and nights. There is a good bed to sleep in, no food to eat, but you have to suffer. If you want to exercise, you can go to the gym, run a marathon


, and besides, isn't hiking also a herd thing? When you live in the world, is there anything that is unique to you?


These are nothing. The most hateful thing is that these trivial matters that she spends all her energy to deal with every day are nothing more than the details of ordinary life. Whether she can deal with them or not is worthless and meaningless. Maybe Cheng Dongliang is right. She is just working hard in vain.


Cheng Yuchen found a piece of paper on the wiper, glanced at it, and handed it to Zhao Youyou. It was a pink form. The only things that could be recognized were the Arabic numerals representing the date and her license plate number. It looked like a ticket. Zhao Youyou opened the translation software and scanned it. A few shocking words popped up: Crime Notice! She looked down nervously and roughly understood what was going on. She parked her car where she shouldn't have parked last night, infringing on the rights of others. She had to pay a fine of 20 euros within a certain period of time and go to the police station to pick up the license plate after 10 days. At the bottom of the crime notice, it was written in large letters: Offender. Probably a crime. At this time, an old lady with a clear face came silently from the corner, her smile slowly stretched out like the tentacles of a snail, trying to approach the mother and son on the roadside. Zhao Youyou smiled and grabbed the life-saving straw and hurriedly asked the kind neighbor:


"Good morning! May I ask what happened with it?" Zhao Youyou couldn't wait to greet slowly, and directly handed the piece of paper in her hand to the old lady.


"Καλημέρα (Good morning)" The old lady shook her head, indicating that she didn't understand English. She squinted her eyes and glanced at the piece of paper, then looked at Zhao Youyou's car, pointed to the no-parking sign in front of the Spiros Courtyard, shook her hand and said: "Όχι, εδώ απαγορεύεται το παρκάρισμα." (No parking here)


Zhao Youyou then saw a white iron sign hanging on the gate next to her. In the middle was a faded red capital P, with a slash splitting the P in half, indicating that P was not accepted. She hadn't noticed this at all last night. But if it was a violation, why did the police take away her license plate? On second thought, that was right. China's electronic eyes were spread out like Skynet. The evidence of violation was solid, and the crime could not be committed. There was no need to bother the traffic police. But in Greece, even the traffic lights were often broken, not to mention the electronic eyes. They could not be managed online, and could only be managed offline. The license plates were flat, so it was convenient to collect and return them. It didn't delay legal education. Cars without license plates could not be driven, and they could only reflect on themselves at home. Greeks are best at dealing with practical problems, and their methods are often light and practical.


The people in the house heard the noise and walked out of the balcony. A tall middle-aged man walked through the yard and came to the door. He had thick hair and a playful expression.


"Κalimela, Malaka, hope you enjoy your ticket." (Good morning, asshole, I hope you enjoy your ticket) He said to Zhao Youyou, holding his own gate with his hand. His burly body cast a huge shadow on the ground, completely blocking the sunlight above Zhao Youyou's head and casting a huge shadow behind her. Zhao Youyou recognized that this was the Land Rover driver who blocked her car yesterday.


Zhao Youyou now understood the whole story. She parked her car last night and blocked his garage door, and he called the police to take away her license plate. To be honest, it was indeed her fault. But not only did he retaliate in his actions, but his attitude also looked like "I did it on purpose", which was undoubtedly a declaration of war in person.


"What? Did you call the police to take off my plate?" Zhao Youyou asked, to confirm her inference.


“Welcome to Greece, Princess. You can't just do whatever you want here. People


follow the rules,” Spiros replied in a pretentious tone, with the joy of successful revenge.


“Rules? In Greece?” Zhao Youyou was so angry that she couldn't help but sneer. God knows how much the Greeks don't like to follow the rules. Time is running out, she didn't plan to continue arguing, since he lives here, there is a long way to go, she opened the car door and motioned her son to get in the car.


“Bravo! But you can't drive without plates.” Spiros watched her start the car, and kept grabbing the door and shouting.


“Try to stop me!” Zhao Youyou yelled as she started the car and drove out of the street. In her heart, she silently cursed this self-righteous Greek man. Perhaps it was because she was in a foreign country that she tried to be tolerant in everything she did. But at this moment, her anger rushed straight to her head. Do Greeks do things so without giving people room for maneuver? Chinese people advocate gentleness, courtesy and tolerance, but the premise is that you don't really provoke her. You know nothing about the power of anger of Scorpio Chinese women, just wait and see!


"Try not killing people today!" Spiros shouted at the car that was going away. Life is a gorgeous robe, covered with lice. Not only are there lice on the gorgeous robe, but there are even more lice on the coarse cloth shirt. Zhao Youyou parked the car at the bumpy back door of the school. Following Cheng Yuchen into the school, today I have to go to the Parents' Committee to help decorate the Halloween venue. As a new Chinese mother, this is a great opportunity to understand the school and meet other parents.


Mothers often say that children are the kite strings of their mothers. With Cheng Yuchen following her, she doesn't worry that Zhao Youyou will really fly. A mother with a child will not deviate from the norm or make mistakes. Yeong-hye can become a tree, so she can say: Why can't she die? In-hye has a six-year-old Ji-woo, so she can't die. Yeong-hye's tragic death can still be heard with heart-wrenching howls, but In-hye can only quietly decay in her own identity and become the nourishment of her son. Parents of the Parents' Association, no matter which country they come from, are almost all women. The educational spirit of the school is to make students become people with a sense of social responsibility. No one has ever thought this statement is ridiculous. The vast majority of male parents cannot even take on ordinary family responsibilities properly, so where can the so-called sense of social responsibility come from? Before becoming a person with a sense of social responsibility, why not first train your children to become a father (mother) with a sense of family responsibility?


"Yoyo, come here!" (Yoyo, come here) Jane, the chairman of the Parents' Association, greeted her at the door of the warehouse. The candies and decorations for the Halloween party have been bought. Every year, the whole of Europe imports a large amount of plastic and paper products from China for holiday decorations. These colorful and cheap goods are like colorful candy wrappers, wrapping up Christmas, Easter, Carnival, Thanksgiving and Halloween one by one, making them lively and full of childishness. Several Chinese mothers are moving the glowing pumpkins to the exhibition stand at the school gate. A playful mother turns on the battery, and the electric spider flashes red light on the tombstone. Chinese mothers have always been the backbone of the volunteers for this international school's activities. Although most mothers are not very good at English, they always go all out every time the school holds an event.


"How are you, my dear?" Jane hugged Zhao Youyou warmly.


"Keep practicing not to kill people" Zhao Youyou made a driving gesture and teased. Jane knew that she had just bought a car not long ago and was still learning the Greek road rules.


"Better?" Jane asked with a smile.


"No, I need my killing talent today." Zhao Youyou joked with a double entendre, it was Halloween. Besides, she really wanted to kill someone today.


She followed Jane into the warehouse, where there were several large machetes made of foam on the table. She picked up the machete. There was a plastic skeleton in the corner. Zhao Youyou imagined it as the hateful neighbor who called the police to collect her license plate. She slashed at it, and the hateful neighbor fell to the ground. I slashed, I slashed again, and he rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. She couldn't help laughing, put away the knife in a neat gesture, and then asked Jane:


"How are you, Jane? Got all the help you needed?"


Jane laughed. She liked the help of these Chinese mothers very much. They were hardworking, capable, good at cooperation, and unusually generous. And she herself always tried her best to help these families integrate into school life. However, despite the friendliness and enthusiasm of both sides, different cultures and languages ​​still built a high wall of understanding between each other from time to time.


"Let's work," she thought to herself.


"In joint labor, everyone always has the same goal, harmony and happiness!" Jane needs to raise funds through the activities of the Parents' Committee to form a cross-border exchange club. Her son is in grade 11, and she hopes that this club can help her son gain practical experience in social activities. An efficient and trouble-free team is very important.


Labor is a game for adults. People unify their understanding in labor, cooperate with each other in labor, understand each other in labor, and gain a sense of accomplishment and personal identity in labor. Most mothers also know Jane's purpose, but they also enjoy it. This is an opportunity. Everyone who comes here has cut off the past and needs to rebuild a new life framework and social network. This opportunity allows them to observe each other, identify each other, and find similar people. Among the vast four million people, you have to know someone so that you can have a light care when you are in trouble.


For Zhao Youyou, if it weren't for her son, this light care wouldn't be necessary. He is her own line, her own mortal world. She can't fly with him, but even if she can't fly, she has to hang there for half a day and not come down. Even if hanging there is just dealing with some worthless and meaningless details of life, she has to hang there and not come down.


"I think foreign festivals are very interesting. Foreigners are very entertaining. Our festivals are all about eating. Dumplings, rice dumplings, mooncakes, change the festival to change the food. Youyou, don't you think so?" Zhu Hongna said as she put two bloodshot "eyeball" chocolates in front of her eyes to pretend to be a ghost.


"That's because the roots of our country are agricultural civilization. Farmers are naturally pragmatic. Eating well is a respect for the heaven and earth's provision." Zhao Youyou picked up her phone to help her take a picture of this interesting face.


"Then what kind of people do you think would invent these festivals and ways of playing?" Zhu Hongna asked.


"It started with religion and flourished with businessmen. In the final analysis, it's people who create something out of nothing and make empty promises," Zhao Youyou replied.


"You talk very interestingly," Ding Qin, who was sitting on the right, smiled at Zhao Youyou and said. She was putting the candies to be sold in the evening into a bag.


"Greece is an Orthodox church, and it shouldn't celebrate Halloween. We are making a fuss here, isn't it just to raise funds?" Zhao Youyou was distributing candies. She was upstream of Ding Qin on the production line.


"We celebrate Halloween because we are an American school." Tracy, who was cutting colored paper in the distance, also joined the discussion.


"The most primitive Halloween is to find some firewood to build a fire and drive away the ghosts. Maybe during a ghost drive, the merchants made up a story about the goods on hand and taught the children to wear masks and knock on the door to ask for candy. It's a big holiday, and parents want their children to be happy." Zhao Youyou said.


"Don't worry about whether it has commercial factors or not. First of all, it makes the children happy. This is the most important thing. I hope my children can always keep their innocence. This is why we decided to move to Greece. The education in China is too competitive. Children can't even play. For us, playing well is the first priority. We don't go to any cram school. Whenever we have time, we use it to travel. We just came back from France a few days ago." Tracy is very serious about the festival activities. Everyone fell silent when she spoke.


"We don't go to cram school either." After a while, Zhu Hongna saw that no one said anything, and she was afraid that Tracy would be embarrassed, so she added a sentence. After Zhao Youyou distributed the candy, she took her bag and hurried out to JUMBO to buy Halloween props and costumes for her son. JUMBO is the largest small commodity supermarket in Greece. Walking into JUMBO is like walking into Yiwu. There are rows of masks, hats, robes, the Grim Reaper holding a sickle, braziers spitting flames, Bonnie Rabbit, Hello Kitty, Casper the Imp and Dracula the Vampire. All are from China. Customers shuttled in and out, trying on various costumes, and turning on the sound effects of props from time to time, and the eerie laughter came one after another. When passing an arm caught by a car model, Zhao Youyou remembered the tragic experience of his car being delisted, and suddenly had an idea.


3. Halloween fight
As night fell, Cheng Yuchen put on a pink pullover and a Squid Game mask and went to participate in the school activities with his good friends. Cheng Yuchen's mask was painted with a triangle, and Lu Ming's was a square, corresponding to different characters in the Squid Game. The only girl, Wang Xuanyang, dressed up as a puppet doll in a yellow T-shirt jacket and orange suspender skirt. Several people helped each other adjust their clothes and went out chattering. Cheng Yuchen walked while telling his mother to prepare candy and come to Trick-or-Treat with other friends later. After the children left, Zhao Youyou took out her mobile phone and began to search for photos of Sadako in the Japanese horror film "Midnight Ring". "Midnight Ring" was the scariest horror film she had ever seen. Sadako was thrown into a well and slowly died, and finally became a resentful female ghost, with pupils falling to the lower eyelids and long hair covering most of her face. When someone played a videotape about her story, she would crawl out of the TV with twisted limbs. Zhao Youyou selected a particularly hideous green face and downloaded it to the album, printed it out on A4 paper, and then used white latex to stick a large photo of Sadako on the plastic mask bought at JUMBO. A green LED light that flickered on and off was glued to the back of the mask. Then she put on the wig, white robe, and half of her arm that she bought at JUMBO and slipped into the yard.


Zhao Youyou's backyard was connected to Spiros' garage, separated by a cement flower trough with several shrubs planted in it as a partition. Spiros usually drove in reverse, with the driver's seat against the cement trough. Zhao Youyou planned to place Sadako in the bushes, so that only the driver would have the opportunity to appreciate this female ghost trying to struggle out of the bushes.


Scorpio is indeed a constellation that takes pleasure in revenge. Zhao Youyou excitedly pinned her fake arms to her robe, making them crawl on the ground one after the other. She also stuffed a Greek-style earthenware jar used as decoration in her yard into her robe as Sadako's body. She tied the mask to a mineral water bottle with a rubber band and stuck it on the edge of the cement trough. Finally, she put on a long black wig. When she turned on the light, even Zhao Youyou was startled. Compared with Saw, the Eastern horror was the most terrifying.


After the arrangement was completed, she opened a bottle of Astyk dry white from Santorini and sat down on the balcony. She turned on the JBL mini speaker and played Shostakovich, waiting for the first shot of her counterattack. Greece's unique geographical location makes any wine clear and rich, even the cheap wine bought in the supermarket is quite delicious. After drinking half a glass of wine, Zhao Youyou had another inspiration. She ran down the yard and stuffed the speaker into the earthenware jar.


Just as she ran back to the balcony, Spiros' car had already arrived at the door. The electric gate slowly opened, and the car slowly backed in, turned off the engine... and there was no movement for a long time. Zhao Youyou was so nervous that she couldn't even help but click the play button on her phone. Fortunately, she stopped it in time and didn't make any sound. There was still no movement in the car. The children might have gone to their grandparents' house for the weekend, or they might have gone to Trick-or-Treat with their friends to get candy. The damn neighbor might be on the phone, or maybe... it was just a normal middle-aged man's brief escape from reality after turning off the engine. For a full ten minutes, Zhao Youyou was about to give up, when the car door opened and the tall figure of the neighbor got out of the car. She hurriedly pressed the play button on her phone....the sound of hollow and distant music...the rustling of the wind in the woods...the strange sound of struggling...the weightless sound of something falling into a deep pit...the shrill cry of a woman, coming from the white belly of the dishevelled, flickering green ghost face on the ground... When the neighbor found the white-clothed, green-faced female ghost lying on the ground, she instantly jumped up more than half a meter high, danced in the air in an extremely rare posture, then returned to the ground, then slammed the hood of the car and let out a loud roar. The roar sounded like a wild wolf howling, as if it was about to lose its humanity and turn into a werewolf. Out of consideration for her own safety, Zhao Youyou quickly stopped filming and ran back to the room. After a while, the werewolf regained his sanity and took a closer look at the device. He kicked Sadako, grabbed her head and threw it into Zhao Youyou's yard. He walked home with angry, thumping steps.


The spirit of entertainment is indeed a good thing. Even if you are scared like a dog, you can't really lose your temper, otherwise it will be "no sense of humor." Zhao Youyou drank the wine in the glass contentedly, humming "The sun sets in the west, the red clouds fly, the soldiers return to the camp after shooting." After packing up the things in the yard, the troops returned to the camp. Tomorrow I have to go to the police station to get the license plate back, this matter is not over yet. As soon as I entered the house and crumpled Sadako's face into a ball and threw it into the trash can, a message popped up on her social platform. When I opened it, it was a friend she added when she first arrived in Athens, Steve, a professional wheelchair basketball player in Athens.


"Great, sister, did you get your license plate removed because of random parking?" Steve asked gloatingly. He saw the post Zhao Youyou posted asking how to get the license plate back.


Steve is a young and handsome guy who looks a bit like Charlie Sheen when he was young. He lost a leg when he drove too fast at the age of 20, and then started playing wheelchair basketball and made it to the professional league. Steve kept asking Zhao Youyou if she wanted to go drinking with him, and persuaded her that the advantage of going out drinking with him was that


there was a seat even if there was no reservation. "You have a seat but I don't," Zhao Youyou said. "You can sit on me, I don't mind, you're not that heavy." Steve is very satisfied with his uniqueness. The car accident changed his life, and in a good way. Before the car accident, Steve worked as a waiter in a restaurant. He was an ordinary young man among the masses. After losing his right leg, he started playing basketball, filming commercials, and became an inspirational figure. He was constantly involved in various activities every day, and continued to drive a sports car fearlessly, driving 180 degrees on the streets of Athens at night. Maybe he was not an ordinary young man, but the car accident made him find an outlet. No matter how active he was, Zhao Youyou always felt that he was still lonely and talked a lot. She was willing to talk to him more, but she didn't know what to say to someone who was only half her age. She really couldn't resonate with his noisy Greek music. He said that classical music made him want to sleep. "I didn't stop on purpose. Who knew that you couldn't stop there? Please teach me how to deal with this ticket." Zhao Youyou replied to Steve's teasing.


"I'm telling you, you can't be rude to the Greeks, you have to beg them. Go and cry to the police tomorrow: I'm a foreigner, I have to pick up my kids every day, can you please help me get my license plate back as soon as possible? They will soften their hearts immediately." Steve gave Zhao Youyou advice.


"Can it be as soon as possible? I saw that the ticket says 10 days," Zhao Youyou asked.


"Why else would you go to the police? Or, you push me to the police station, and I'll tell them that you have to take me to the hospital every day."


"Really? Are you free tomorrow?"


"Oh, I can't tomorrow, I have a game."


"Okay, I appreciate your kindness, I'll go and see what's going on tomorrow."


"Seriously, I can do it the day after tomorrow."


There are excuses for the day after tomorrow. The Greeks give countless warm care and help every day. They are good at giving advice, but they have a hard time taking actual actions. They have to visit relatives, exercise, play ball, drink coffee, and attend friends' birthday parties. In short, they are too busy to do anything. Besides, it will only be a few days before the license plate is returned the day after tomorrow.


There is a problem with the Greeks' help in giving advice, and all the advice they give is high-level. The focus is on: how to deal with the police, change the rules, shorten the penalty period, and get the license plate as soon as possible. But they don't know that for Zhao Youyou, a foreigner, the most basic question is: with so many police stations, which one should I go to? The police station that issued the ticket is affiliated with Maroussi, which is located next to the Olympic Center. When Zhao Youyou went there, the blue iron door was wide open and there was no doorman. She walked straight into the office building. Nine out of ten offices were empty. The corridor was empty. An office worker looked up and saw her in the office. Instead of questioning or asking, he turned around and continued to make his own phone call. Finally, she walked to the door of an office with a counter and saw a police officer in uniform. She quickly caught up with him and asked:


"Good morning, my license plate has been removed, I'm here to pay, is this the cashier counter?"


The handsome police officer looked calm, one hand turning the wedding ring on the other hand, as if processing what she said. After about ten seconds, he spoke to a police officer who looked like an older woman next to him. The older woman explained it to him seriously, then turned to Zhao Youyou and asked,


"Where did you get the license plate on your car?"


"I don't know, I bought the car in the city center." Zhao Youyou tried hard to recall whether the car dealership manager had told her where the license plate was. She had no impression.


Costas, a burly man, explained the payment information very clearly, but other information was very vague: "Costas' English is not good... Costas is old and has a bad memory... Honey, I'm in the hospital, I have a heart problem..." Zhao Youyou, who was eager to pick up the car, could only comfort him in this situation: "I can understand everything you said... You are not old, and you look very energetic... Are you feeling better? Can I get my deposit back?" As soon as the money was asked to be refunded, Costas disappeared without a trace. God bless Costas. The handsome police officer and the older police officer chatted again. The older police officer explained carefully. After the police officer understood, he turned to Zhao Youyou and said word by word:


"First, you have to go to the bank or post office to pay the fine; second, after you get the receipt, go to the police headquarters in the city center, your license plate will be transferred there, you need to make an appointment with them to apply, and then wait for them to notify you to


get the license plate." It turned out that the fine was not paid here! Steve didn't think that Zhao Youyou didn't understand the basic process at all. He didn't mention to her how to pay the fine at all. She came to the police station as a matter of course, hoping to get it done in one go. This is Greece, how can one thing be done in one go? Well, at least I got some information, so it wasn't a completely wasted trip. Next, find a bank to pay the fee.


Just as she walked through the door, the handsome police officer stopped her: "Wait a minute." Zhao Youyou turned around and went back to the office. "You wrote the wrong date on this ticket. The date of the accident is the 3rd, and the date of the ticket is the 2nd. You can complain to the police who handled it and ask them to return your license plate as soon as possible." Okay, another high-level advice. Why don't you tell me which counter to go to at the bank to pay the fee? This is more useful. Even so, Zhao Youyou said goodbye with gratitude and left again. The Olympic Plaza was empty. The sun cast neat stripes under the huge white pergola in the center of the square. The strong wind ran back and forth across the square. Zhao Youyou walked along, reciting the next process silently all the way, bank...payment...police station...appointment...apply...wait for notification...get license plate...


The bank's door is double-layered, and you can only open the other door when one door is closed. The strict barriers make people feel that there is a robbery going on inside. It's very casual when you really enter the door, and no one even comes to greet you. The completely decentralized lobby, account managers are randomly distributed in front of desks without any signs, and there is no such thing as a customer counter. For a while, people don't know who to say hello to. At this time, a middle-aged female staff member looked up, and before she could dodge, Zhao Youyou caught her sight.


"Good afternoon, where can I apply for a traffic ticket?" Zhao Youyou asked. The


female staff member looked confused, so Zhao Youyou had to repeat the question again.


"I'm sorry, I don't understand the business you are talking about. We don't handle this here."


"Excuse me, do you know which bank accepts payment?" Zhao Youyou asked desperately.


"I'm sorry, I don't know."


It was almost three o'clock in the afternoon. The bank had closed when I came out of the police station. I finally waited until two o'clock to open, but I didn't get anything out of it. Fortunately, I can still go to the post office to pay, but if I rush there at this time, the post office must be closed. Great, running around all day long, in vain, and accomplishing nothing.


"Mom, when can we use the car?" Cheng Yuchen stood in the kitchen watching Zhao Youyou cook.


"I don't know, baby. Didn't we have a car when we first came?" Zhao Youyou took out the thawed beef and put it on the chopping board.


"When we first came here, we lived near the subway, but now this place is too far from the subway," Cheng Yuchen complained.


We thought that having a car could expand our radius of action, but once we moved to this remote place, the car was sealed. Zhao Youyou took out the sharpening rod and polished the meat cleaver one by one.


It was early in the morning again, and I took the ticket to find the post office. The post office's facade was not prominent, and I walked around the same block several times before I found the place. This is a place that is a bit like a domestic express delivery station. Behind the long counter stood a long-haired, pale-faced staff member who was chatting with a neighbor. Zhao Youyou stood aside and waited for them to finish talking. Three or four minutes passed, and the discussion did not stop. In the middle, the neighbor handed the staff a document, and the two sides continued a new round of communication. Fortunately, they were not interrupted at the beginning. It turned out that they were not neighbors chatting, but people who really came to do business. From beginning to end, Zhao Youyou didn't figure out what business these two people were handling. Finally, the long-haired staff member saw that she was waiting hard, so he stopped and asked her what business she wanted to handle. She explained her purpose, and the long-haired man replied:


"You can't pay here, you have to go to the post office


." "Isn't this the post office?" Zhao Youyou looked at the ELTA (post office) written on the door before entering.


"This is the ELTA Courier, you have to go to the ELTA Post Office to pay," the long-haired man patiently explained.


Only those who have been stumped by such trivial matters again and again abroad will know how aggrieved they feel at this moment. It is a feeling similar to when you were a child and finally got an ice cream, but accidentally dropped it on the ground. A complex feeling of grievance, irritability, hatred of one's own stupidity and powerlessness. The "neighbor" next to her said to Zhao Youyou:


"Come on, give me your mobile map."


Zhao Youyou switched the keyboard to Greek input mode and handed over her mobile phone honestly. The "neighbor" poked an address on her mobile phone and said to her: "This place is the nearest post office, but as far as I know, they stop handling business at 10:30, you have to hurry up." After saying thank you and going out, I took two steps at a time and ran to my destination.


Many daily trivial matters do not have any logical difficulty, but only habits, experience, and deviations in understanding. When you finish handling them, you will find that this matter is extremely simple. It's like a maze. After you walk out, the tracks behind you are connected into a line, and you will feel that this is an obvious path. But when you are in it for the first time, you will feel at a loss and confused, and keep hitting walls everywhere.


This is probably the process of a child stumbling and growing up. It really requires a lot of courage and optimism. It's a pity that adults have forgotten how they grew up. Zhao Youyou rushed to the post office in the last ten minutes, took a number to queue up, explained the situation, paid the fee, and got the receipt GET√, all in one go. Next, you can make an online appointment with the police station to get the license plate. After Zhao Youyou completed the appointment on the roadside, she felt a little sense of accomplishment for the first time. It took two days and ran dozens of kilometers from north to south, and finally the payment was successful! Counting the successful appointment, the progress bar of the license plate project has moved forward 45%.


Although she still didn't get the license plate, Zhao Youyou returned home happily. One step at a time, one link at a time. She didn't think about how small the task she had completed was after spending so much time. Two working days, according to her previous job income, was about 20,000 yuan. It was difficult for her relatives and friends to understand her behavior, and even she couldn't explain why she had to put everything down and come here to deal with these worthless difficulties. She took out the key with satisfaction and prepared to open the door, and a courier came over with a large package.


"Excuse me, is there someone named Spiros Panpadreou on the second floor?" The courier scanned the name on the access control. There were three households on the second floor, and one was empty and blank. The other two names were Youyou Zhao and Julia Garcia. It was the first time that Zhao Youyou knew that the hateful neighbor was named Spiros. "I've never heard of anyone named Spiros in this building." Zhao Youyou didn't lie, but she didn't have good intentions.


"Really? The address says 18 Lianis Street, second floor, isn't that right?" The courier checked the address again.


"There must be a mistake. I live on the second floor. My name is not Spiros. The tenant next to me moved out a long time ago. Could it be that person's delivery?" Zhao Youyou said calmly. Every word she said was factual, but every word was deliberately confusing. In fact, there was no need. The courier didn't intend to investigate it carefully. He just wrote that the door-to-door delivery was unsuccessful, and the order would be passed to the next courier.


Zhao Youyou didn't know what assessment system Greek couriers used. She had been waiting for forty days for the TV she bought before, and finally she ran to the courier headquarters to get it back. When the TV was delivered to her home and opened, the LCD screen was broken. It was probably because of the damage, so no one was willing to take responsibility, so it was thrown in the warehouse. Zhao Youyou had made countless calls before and repeatedly left messages on the platform's social media to ask about it, but there was no trace of it. Finally, she went to the courier headquarters far away in the southern suburbs, recorded the whole process and collected evidence, repeatedly confirmed, this oppressive rights protection scared the five Greeks at the headquarters. The next morning, the TV arrived, but it was broken. After another complete round trip, she successfully returned the product. It took two months to finally watch TV. At that time, she was excited about her victory and had no idea about her future life. Every day, she would repeat similar


monster-killing activities, and all she killed were slimes, low-level soldiers, and there was no hope of upgrading. Watching the courier brother leave with the hateful neighbor's package, Zhao Youyou felt that the hardship of running around these days was slightly relieved.


4. Young Bach



The Attica Regional Police Headquarters is located at 173 Alexander Street. It is one of the few high-rise buildings in Athens, with 13 floors! The square building, with neat small lattice glass windows, looks like a large waffle from the front. Entering the explosion-proof glass door reinforced with steel bars, you must first pass the security check, hand in your umbrella and other dangerous items, then register your personal information, hand in your passport, and receive a visitor badge. Only then can you go upstairs to do business. The terrazzo spiral staircase leads to the elevator room on the fourth floor, which is the traffic violation handling office. All kinds of traffic violation people are queuing up with solemn faces waiting for their numbers to be called. Instigated by Steve, Zhao Youyou also plans to try crying performance to see if she can get a license plate as soon as possible.


She wore a beige wool suit. The character conception is that the formal suit conveys a good professional background, and the soft color strengthens her gentle personality. The combination of the two gives the police a good impression of "good citizen, please let go." There was nothing wrong with her idea, but she stood out among the crowd of people wearing jackets and motorcycle uniforms who violated traffic rules on motorcycles. Fortunately, we can use a smile to resolve the embarrassment. Zhao Youyou tried to strengthen her belief in her heart. When she heard her number being called, she came to the police officer honestly: "Good morning, Mr. Officer" 49 "Sit down, what's the matter?" The police officer smiled and looked kind. "My license plate was taken away"


"Illegal parking, right?" The police took a form from a pile of forms on the corner of the table.


"Yes, this is my payment receipt." Zhao Youyou handed over the receipt and ticket in her hand.


The police officer took a look at the receipt, picked up the ticket and began to fill out the form according to the form. Zhao Youyou was still wondering when it would be more appropriate to cry. The police officer handed the form to her and said: "Sign."


Zhao Youyou signed honestly and muttered softly: "Then when can I get the license plate?"


"Doesn't it say ten days later on the ticket?" The police officer said with a smile.


Zhao Youyou was about to start reciting the prepared lines: "I am a foreigner... I have to pick up my children from school every day. My home is far away. I really didn't park illegally on purpose..." The police officer said:


"Come and get it the day after tomorrow."


"Ah? Not today?" Although it was a bit too much, if I could get it today, wouldn't I have to make a trip tomorrow?


"The license plate is not here. It needs to be transferred from Marusi." The police officer explained concisely. He waved the application form and said: "I have helped you a lot." Zhao Youyou looked around and saw that the motorcycle uniforms around her were indeed filling out the forms themselves. Even if she came to pick it up the day after tomorrow, it was several days earlier than expected. With sincere gratitude to the police officer, she left happily and went downstairs to get her passport and umbrella. At this time, even the patch-like wig on the head of the staff collecting the documents looked cute.


The car was brought back just in time, just in time to go to the Ancient Theater of Athens to listen to Yo-Yo Ma's concert.


The Theater of Herodes Atticus is a famous ancient open-air theater in Greece. It is built on the mountain. The huge semicircular auditorium is composed of layers of stone steps. After two thousand years of wind and frost, many of the walls and stone pillars of the theater have been damaged, but it is still usable. When the audience walked into the theater one after another, night had fallen. The broken marble pillars and arches were illuminated by spotlights, with the background of the deep blue night sky and the jade-colored full moon. This scene reminded Zhao Youyou of the Old Summer Palace. The changes of history left these ruins, the old civilization was violently torn off and crushed, and the new trend covered the past trauma. Only these big stones that fell beside their bases, silently and stubbornly tried to maintain their original shape.


On the way here, Cheng Yuchen found the logo of Oracle Corporation on a building on the side of the road. "Wow, there are oracle bones in Athens." He shouted excitedly. The year Cheng Yuchen was born, Apple mobile phones officially entered China. What followed was the explosion of smart application technology, which made this generation of children have a natural love for high technology. They can operate touch screens skillfully before they can walk, and they can interact with electronic products easily before they can speak.


Zhao Youyou doesn't know what kind of existence Athens is in the eyes of them who have been surrounded by glass-walled high-rise buildings of technology companies since childhood. There are no high-rise buildings here, and no buildings with glass curtain walls. Unmanaged wastelands and crude graffiti can be seen everywhere. When you walk on the streets of Athens, the floor will turn into glass. Under the glass are historical relics of a certain period. They are carefully dissected by archaeologists, preserved in the place where they were discovered, and solemnly sealed with glass, embedded under the houses built by modern people, like amber.


"Athens is the capital of a country after all, baby. It's not surprising that there are technology companies," Zhao Youyou said.


Today, in the Stone Theater in this capital of a country, the famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma will play Bach, Beethoven, Elgar, Dvorak, Brahms and Tan Dun here. In the past three hundred years, Bach's music is not the first time to sound in the Theater of Herodes Atticus, and this time is definitely not the last time.


Compared with several other musicians, Bach's music has a neat structure and steady rhythm, which is calm and heavy, like a solemn elder. When the lights dimmed, the focus of the audience was on Yo-Yo Ma, who was sitting alone in the center of the stage. He began to pull the bowstring, and the familiar melody of Bach's First Cello Overture in G Major, in this theater with a history of 2,000 years, the lively layers of advancement seemed particularly young. In front of Hermes' harp and Athena's flute, how could Bach's harpsichord be considered an ancient instrument? Not only Bach, but even the entire Baroque period, was just a flash of fireworks for the Herodes Atticus Theater.


Every era has its own hot spots, and it is hard to imagine how much the next generation will despise the solemnity of the present. But no matter how world-renowned and devastating the events were at the time, they were only dazzling sparks that were fleeting on the timeline of the entire human civilization.


ChatGPT can already perceive the sounds and images of the outside world, and even the emotions of the other party, and "Her" is about to come out. Elon Musk's robotic arm successfully clamped the rocket booster, clearing another obstacle for the new "Artemis" moon landing plan. Human beings' romantic yearning for the beauty of Artemis may have started on a quiet moonlit night in ancient times. It is not limited to any era or race. No matter how absurd and difficult it seemed at the time, Prometheus' disciples never stopped their pursuit. The road has been long for thousands of years, and it will eventually be realized. Technology, economy, skyscrapers, electric cars, artificial intelligence, the hot spots are always facing the future, but there will always be people who do their best to retain some traces of history, so that everyone has the opportunity to look back and feel the insignificance and vastness of human beings.


When the resolute and vivid music of Beethoven's Second and Fifth Symphonies and Triple Concerto sounded, at first only a few audience members in the back row broke free from the restraints of their seats and stood up with applause, then people stood up row by row, and finally more than 5,000 audience members in the theater stood up collectively, and the applause exploded like firecrackers, becoming part of the music beat.


In Zhao Youyou's career, emotions were considered anti-intellectual and a shortcoming of female managers. She has been strictly trained in the expression of emotions in the past 20 years. Any expression needs to have a clear purpose, and pure personal feelings will not appear in the workplace. The emotions seen by colleagues are the products of calibration and purification, and they need to have the ability to promote events. But now, look at these Greek audiences in front of you, clapping passionately, praising affectionately, and standing up and sitting down again, fearing that they have not been able to fully express their emotions. For them, the only task at this moment is to allow music to blend with emotions and let feelings flow freely. Emotions do not need to be attached to other values. Emotions themselves are meaningful.


The music emptied the reality, the atmosphere infected the mood, and Zhao Youyou seemed to have entered a state of tipsiness. She didn't remember how she found the car, nor did she remember what the way back was like. In her mind, there were only bright street lights, which stretched into long lines on both sides of the car.


"When I was young, I liked Bach, neat and pleasant. Now I feel like I can resonate with Beethoven," Zhao Youyou chattered to her son while parking the car.


"I like Beethoven, he has more personality and more emotions." Cheng Yuchen has been learning piano since elementary school and also likes classical music.


"Indeed, Bach is composed by science and engineering men. According to your preference, I don't see you like Paganini much?" Zhao Youyou locked the car and began to look for the key in her bag.


"Paganini is so evil, I'm not that extreme," Cheng Yuchen said disapprovingly.


"That doesn't prevent him from being nice, but music can indeed reflect a person's personality." Zhao Youyou didn't find the key in her bag, and then began to catch lice all over her body.


"Paganini likes to show off his skills. You know he has Marfan syndrome, right?" Cheng Yuchen circled around his mother. His mood was also warmed up by the music and he was somewhat excited.


"Did you remember to lock the door when we went out?" Zhao Youyou didn't respond. "I don't remember. People with Marfan syndrome have extremely long fingers." Cheng Yuchen didn't notice that Zhao Youyou began to panic. She reopened the car door and searched the car repeatedly.


"I have bad news, son." Zhao Youyou searched unsuccessfully and got out of the car and said to her son.


"Did you forget to bring your keys?" Cheng Yuchen asked.


"That's right! I was so focused on putting on makeup and matching clothes that I forgot to take my keys when I went out." Zhao Youyou looked down at her bare legs in high heels. Athens in late autumn is not cold, but it is not the season to stay outdoors in a skirt in the middle of the night. "What should we do now?" Cheng Yuchen opened the car door and got back in. Although he didn't know the solution, he could at least start the energy-saving mode.


"Spend a night in the car, or find a B&B for a night, or..." Being in a foreign country, without any relatives, and about to be homeless... When she thought of this, Zhao Youyou cheered up and made a decision: think of a way! She looked up and scanned the house that was so close but could not be entered. Suddenly, her eyes lit up. She saw the balcony of her bedroom. Because she was in a hurry when she left, she forgot to put down the roller shutter. The temperature in Athens in August can reach 40 degrees. According to tradition, most residents will go to cool islands or other countries to cool off. At this time in Athens, the roads are empty, the shopping malls are closed, and the whole city will go into "summer hibernation". But around the 1990s, due to political turmoil in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, immigrants began to pour into Greece. At the beginning of this century, Greece joined the European Union, and a large number of rural people entered Athens with the urbanization process. With the rapid increase in population, the personnel structure has become more and more complicated. When people returning from vacation found that their homes had been looted, the small reinforcement measure of roller shutters became the standard for every household. The era of Athens not closing the doors at night has since become history.


Zhao Youyou had no time to trace the life of the rolling door. Her focus now was on how to break in. It was estimated that the bedroom balcony was more than one meter wide from the balcony next door, and she could jump over it in one step by holding on to the wall. If the neighbor, the person whose name she had erased, could have stood by and watched her die, she might not have been homeless. What's more, no matter where she went tonight, the key would not fly out by itself. In the final analysis, she still had to find a way to open the door and get in, right?


With a social smile and a deep breath, she rang the doorbell next door. After a long time, she finally heard someone walking out with a crackling sound, shouting angrily: "Δεν ξέρεις με ποιον τα βάζεις!" Judging from the sound, it was probably something like "Who is it? Are you looking for death in the middle of the night?" The door was suddenly opened, and Spyros, with disheveled hair and sleepy eyes, appeared in front of her. "Good evening, dear sir, I am very sorry to bother you so late. It's like this, I forgot to bring my key, and I was wondering if I could climb back to my house from your balcony... If I can, it would really be a great help to me." Zhao Youyou tried to make herself look sincere and pitiful.


Spyros had a blank expression on his face and said nothing. He was probably not awake yet, and was still restarting his brain. Maybe he didn't hear her request clearly? Zhao Youyou cleared her throat and prepared to say it again. Spyros looked up and down at Zhao Youyou, who was wearing a small dress with heavy makeup, and finally spoke:


"No, Princess, you can't climb back to your house from my balcony."


"Why not? I really didn't bring my key. Please help me, it only takes one minute." Zhao Youyou crossed her arms in front of her chest, posing the Greek gesture of expressing gratitude.


"If you fall down and die, I can't afford the responsibility!" Spyros waved his hand, motioning her to leave quickly.


"I apologize if I ever parked my car in front of your garage and blocked you, or scared you on Halloween..." Zhao Youyou refused to give up, clinging to the door frame and trying to get it.


"Oh, oh, it's you! If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known it was you. You took so much trouble to get a lot of ghost things, but they were specially prepared for me?" Spiros was beaming with joy, pretending to be suddenly enlightened.


"I'm sorry, it was just a joke..." Thinking of the scene where Spiros jumped up and screamed miserably because of Sadako, I couldn't help laughing. Zhao Youyou used the remaining rationality to maintain the expression of heartache and regret on her face, but Spiros was completely unmoved. This woman has been welded into his blacklist! Zhao Youyou thought in annoyance, if I had let his son come to communicate with him earlier, maybe there would be some room for negotiation.


"I told you no, ma'am. It's already midnight, you are harassing me." Spiros took out his mobile phone and started searching for something.


No way, he called the police to remove my license plate before, and now he wants to call the police to sue me for harassment? Zhao Youyou couldn't believe it. Can people really hold grudges like this? She sighed, took a step back, and began to think about whether she could ask the neighbor upstairs to see if she could rappel down from her house. But in this way, the possibility of falling to death is even greater. Hey!


"Wait," Spiros shouted to Zhao Youyou. He dialed the phone, said a few words to the other end of the phone, then turned to Zhao Youyou and said: "I called a locksmith for you, it will be here in about 10 to 20 minutes."


Zhao Youyou regretted wiping the sincere and pitiful expression from her face too early. Although this person has a bad attitude, at least he has not completely lost his humanity. "You're welcome, good night," Spiros waved impatiently without waiting for Zhao Youyou to give any feedback, and slammed the door in front of her.


The locksmith almost hummed a little tune as he rode his motorcycle over. He has a thick build, a round face with a relaxed smile, and when he took off his helmet, he shook his fluffy golden hair like a puppy, as if he was on the set of "Top Gun". Zhao Youyou came forward and said worriedly:


"My door lock seems to be difficult to open. Don't you need to bring any tools?"


"Don't worry, ma'am, please trust my professionalism." He patted his chest, emphasizing his reliability, and came to the door of Zhao Youyou's house with empty hands.


"Did you lock the door when you went out?" He touched the keyhole and asked.


"I don't remember locking the door. I should have forgotten to bring the key when I went out." Zhao Youyou searched the scene of going out again in her mind. Damn it, she was only thinking about how to dress up to look good and be worthy of the gorgeous concert. In fact, the theater was dark, and I didn't know who she was dressed up for. Was it to pay tribute to Yo-Yo Ma and Bach? I don't know if the two of them received the respect that I paid a heavy price for?


The locksmith stared at the door lock, crossed his arms, touched his nose, and took a deep breath to show that it was difficult to do. Zhao Youyou asked worriedly: "What? Is this lock difficult to open? I told you so."


The locksmith shook his head, stared at Zhao Youyou kindly, and asked: "100 euros, can you open it?"


"Open, open!" Zhao Youyou put down the heavy stone in her heart and responded hurriedly.


The locksmith took out a small piece of iron from his trouser pocket, put it into the crack of the door and fiddled with it for a few times. It took about ten seconds in total, and the door that bullied the weak and feared the strong suddenly opened. In an instant, the panic of sleeping on the street was lifted, and the warm embrace of the lost and regained home made people feel grateful.


It's true that having many skills is good, I also want to be a locksmith. Zhao Youyou thought with emotion. While taking out two 50-euro bills from his wallet, he handed them to the locksmith. The locksmith took the money and put it in his pocket with a mocking smile. "Good night, Princess." He waved his finger from his forehead, saluted, and turned away. Zhao Youyou suddenly understood something. Not only did Spiros


negotiate a "good price" for her, he also gave her a contrived nickname and spread it around. Well, a gentleman's revenge is never too late. Zhao Youyou went into the room, threw her bag on the table, kicked off her high heels and fell on the sofa. The ups and downs of this night, the mixed joys and sorrows made me exhausted, and let me sleep well tonight.


5. Shared Cat
According to statistics from the animal lover community, there are about four million homeless animals in Greece.


"Do you know? There were no parrots in Athens ten years ago," Zhao Youyou and illustrator Yanis said to her as they strolled around the national park. At that time, they had just finished a lesson with the same tennis coach and walked out of the club with their rackets on their backs. Yanis is a middle-aged man with a very typical Greek face, tall and upright, short black curly hair, and a Greek straight nose that he has effortlessly. Everything is standard, but it is not easy to call it handsome. Handsomeness requires the blessing of a special temperament.


At that time, a large group of parrots were holding a meeting in the tree behind the sheepfold, chirping and in full swing. About one day ten years ago, a pair of parrots escaped from the cage. It took more than three thousand days for these red and green birds to occupy the large and small woods in Athens in one fell swoop.


In the center of the park's pool is an artificial mini island, which is densely covered with tortoises, and the island looks like it is covered with scales. The streets of Athens are full of food. The vegetarians include oranges, lemons, and figs, all of which are full and


fall to the ground when they are ripe. The meaty ones include turtles and pigeons, all of which are leisurely strolling around. The Greeks complained that the price of figs has increased from three yuan to seven yuan, and there are many figs on the roadside trees, but they still complained and did not pick them.


The first time Zhao Youyou walked under a large-scale flock of pigeons, she was worried that a "bomb" would fall from the sky. But the pigeons seemed to have the wisdom to coexist with humans and rarely attacked humans with feces. They excreted at designated locations, and in some fair areas, pigeon feces were densely packed.


The largest number of homeless animals is cats. There are three million stray cats in Greece, most of which gather in large cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki. In Athens, you don't need to have your own cat, there are shared cats everywhere, and as long as you are willing to feed them, you can feed them every day. These European shorthair cats of different fur colors live in groups and systematically in human communities. They were raised by humans and human garbage. Each cat has its own trash can wet nurse, a random feeding mother, and a godmother given by the restaurant. As for accommodation, there are catteries in the wild covered with green nets on the mountain, and beds made of old pillows in front of the building. Although they are homeless, they are not without beds to sleep on. No one knows how to distribute these supplies. No matter how fiercely they fight each other, once a human figure appears, all fights will stop. All cat members stand at attention and salute. Even if the visitor does not bring food, they must not show disappointment or pester. They must watch the human walk away in a decent manner before continuing to fight with ghosts and hot voices.


No one really owns them, and no one is responsible for their cat life. Cats are born free and can do whatever they want. People are also free. They can feed them if they want, and they will not starve to death if they don’t want to. This is a non-contractual symbiotic relationship between humans and animals. Animals enjoy freedom, and humans provide non-binding help. Both parties act according to their free will and maintain their duties and moderation.


"This may be the most ideal form of democracy." Zhao Youyou said as he watched a tortoise lose its footing and roll off the back of another tortoise into the pool under the island.


"Democracy? Do you think democracy is an ideal policy?" Yanis sneered.


"I don't know, don't you Westerners talk about democracy all the time? After all, Greece is the birthplace of democracy." Zhao Youyou.


"Look at what Greece is like now? We have the longest working hours in Europe, but the average income ranks last in Europe. This is the chaos brought about by democracy." Yanis raised his little finger and said indignantly.


This is not the first time Zhao Youyou has heard Greeks express their dissatisfaction with the current loose public opinion and ineffective government governance. The dispersion of opinions and the dragging of decision-making have made this country difficult in all aspects. The middle class fantasizes that centralized management can solve the problem.


"This may be what we Chinese say, things will turn into the opposite when they reach the extreme. In the past few decades, the world has been moving towards the "right". When freedom and laxity have hindered economic development, everyone began to yearn for the power and efficiency of the "left", Zhao Youyou said with emotion.


"Let me give you an example. Some time ago, I planned to buy a house, on the premise that I had communicated with my accountant and all the banks, and the banks had guaranteed that I would be able to get a loan. But after I paid the deposit, the landlord added a lot of additional clauses to the formal contract. Listen to one of them: If all banks in Greece go bankrupt and the loan cannot be issued, the buyer needs to pay the seller 20,000 euros in compensation. Can you believe this is true?"


"How is this possible? Will all Greek banks go bankrupt within a few months?" Zhao Youyou also found it incredible.


"The landlord said: What if? Even if there is only a one in a million possibility, it must be written into the contract. In theory, she can do this. But do you think this is an effective way of contracting?" Yannis said.


"In China, we use a unified contract template and have a standardized process. We use the "Apple system". You use the "Android system", and you have to DIY everything. That's why this mess happened." Zhao Youyou was curious as she spoke, what the landlord meant by doing this. "This is the so-called freedom and democracy," Yanis spread his hands, as if asking Zhao Youyou to judge.


"But why did she do this?" Zhao Youyou couldn't think of an answer.


"I don't know either. I have a guess that she used these terms to force me to break the contract so that she could take my deposit," Yanis explained.


Indeed, in the face of complex and changeable human nature, democracy that is based on each doing its own thing often makes it difficult for people to move forward. Perhaps only those stray cats can truly enjoy the benefits of democracy. Zhao Youyou couldn't help but envy those homeless cats. "I think the elegant realization of democracy needs to be based on two basic conditions:


1. There is no shortage of materials;


2. Both the supply and demand sides abide by their duties and are not greedy.


Does Northern Europe meet this condition more?" she said.


"Nordic is more like communism. But you are right, the realization of any ideal state is inseparable from the most basic economic conditions. Greece should learn from China in this regard and implement making money as the most important strategy." Yannis said a little cynically.


"Now only cats can be Diogenes, right?" Zhao Youyou said. Diogenes is a famous Greek philosopher. It is said that he lived in a wooden barrel. Once he was basking in the sun, Alexander the Great came to visit him, asked him what he wanted, and promised to fulfill his wish. Diogenes replied: "I hope you will get out of the way and don't block my sunshine." Alexander the Great said: "If I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes"


"Hahaha, that's right" Yannis laughed helplessly. In addition to democracy and philosophy, Greece is also the birthplace of Western drama. As early as the fifth century BC, Athens gave birth to two major comedy forms: tragedy and comedy. When Zhao Youyou first discussed the cultural background of their respective countries with the Greeks on the Internet, the other party said: "The Greeks' background is Dionysus culture" At first, Zhao Youyou's understanding of Dionysus was limited to desire, revelry, and a life attitude of drinking and enjoying life today. But later it was discovered that Dionysus culture is far more than that. Greek tragedy was born from the worship of Dionysus. As a representative of hedonism, the Dionysus sacrificial dance is a festival of natural liberation. People wear goat skins to sing and dance, eat raw mutton, drink wine, and release their instincts to the utmost. But the hymns and performances are the tragic stories of ancient Greek heroes. The awe of nature and the gods, the praise of the indomitable spirit, the expression of the fearlessness and unruliness of tiny human beings in the form of carnival, and so on, are intricately intertwined. The word "tragedy" in modern English is derived from the ancient Greek word Tragodie, which means "goat song". The ancient Greeks believed that the core of tragedy was serious and noble. Aristotle once said: "Tragedy is an imitation of serious, perfect, and grand behavior." The Greeks on this basis, no matter how wild and willful they are, still have a certain ultimate desolation and solemnity.


In "Iliad", in the Trojan War, Agamemnon, who led the Greek coalition, robbed the female companion and spoils of the famous general Achilles, which made Achilles humiliated and refused to fight, resulting in the death of Achilles' friend Patroclus. In the end, Achilles was angry and decided to go into battle. After returning to the battlefield, he resisted the attack of the Trojans and killed the murderer, and then died on the battlefield.


In "Strategies of the Warring States", after the Qin State destroyed the Zhao State, its troops were heading straight for the southern border of the Yan State. Jing Ke proposed to Prince Dan that he should take the head of the Qin State's rebel general Fan Yuqi and the map of Yan Du Kang to present to the King of Qin and assassinate him. Prince Dan could not bear to kill Fan Yuqi, so Jing Ke had to meet Fan Yuqi privately and tell him the truth. Fan Yuqi committed suicide to help Jing Ke. Jing Ke took the map of Yan Du Kang and the head of Fan Yuqi and went to Qin to assassinate the King of Qin. Before leaving, everyone saw Jing Ke off by the Yishui River. Gao Jianli played the zither, and Jing Ke sang along, "The wind is whistling and the Yishui River is cold. Once the warrior leaves, he will never return." In the end, Jing Ke failed to assassinate the King of Qin. He was seriously injured by the Qin King's sword and was killed by the Qin guards.


"I will never regret what I have done, even if I die nine times." The power of transcending personal life and death and doing what one knows is impossible is not unfamiliar to the Chinese. This may be a similarity between countries with a long history. It may also be because of such a heroic spirit that has transcended human nature that their spirits and civilizations have been able to continue for thousands of years.


The dramatic talent flowing in the blood makes the Greeks born good at acting. Unlike the Chinese who are used to understanding and communicating with the spirit, the Greeks like to express their emotions and ideas with body language, language and expressions. Their acting talent even transcends species and is fully reflected in stray cats.


The stray cats in Greece are not ordinary cats. They are all cat spirits, Oscar-winning actors and actresses. When Zhao Youyou just moved to her new residence, she noticed the two cow cats, one large and one small, with white background and tabby flowers, both with "middle-parted bangs", going in and out of the yard next door. Spyros comes out every morning and evening to feed them. The oversized food bowl is filled with various foods that cannot be identified. Stray cats are very tolerant of food. They prefer human food to cat food, but there is still food left in the big food bowl next door from time to time. It is obvious that either the food is oversupplied or it is not suitable for consumption.


Soon, the two cats began to appear at Zhao Youyou's door. She first noticed their visit two days after moving in, when she was cooking dinner in the kitchen. The pitiful big cat sat upright in front of the glass door of her kitchen, looking at her with big olive green eyes. The little cat was jumping up and down restlessly in the corner far away.


"The neighbor's cat came to recognize the door," Zhao Youyou said loudly to her son in the room.


"What is it doing?" Cheng Yuchen came out of the room and took a look at the big cat squatting at the door.


"Maybe it's saying hello," Zhao Youyou looked at the big cat. It was really a beautiful cat with a well-proportioned bone structure and flowing hair, and it looked a bit like a Maine Coon. What's even more amazing is that it actually caught Zhao Youyou's eyes, tilted its head, looked at her, and made "eye contact". Zhao Youyou was absent-mindedly thinking about whether the fish-flavored pork shreds for dinner might not have enough protein, and whether to add scrambled eggs with green peppers. Her expression was somewhat dull. The big cat's "eyes" carried complex emotions such as observation, understanding, praying, patience, acceptance, etc. For a moment, she couldn't tell who was more human, herself or the cat. The big cat successfully connected with Zhao Youyou's eyes, called out in a coquettish voice, and then lay down on the ground, putting its paws in its arms. It looked like it was going to sit for a long time. Zhao Youyou said:


"Okay, I'll cook, you can do whatever you want."


The cat seemed to have no language barriers and meowed in understanding.


It was still there until Zhao Youyou finished cooking and she and her son finished eating and returned to the kitchen. It looked calm and well-behaved, without any complaints or urging.


"The guests have come to this point, I'm afraid we still need to give them something to eat before we send them away," Zhao Youyou said to his son.


"What to feed it? We don't have any cat food." Cheng Yuchen put the leftovers on the stove.


"Then eat some leftovers." Zhao Youyou scooped a spoonful of rice into the soup of the fish-flavored pork shreds, mixed it, put it into the plastic box of pork in the supermarket, opened the door and went out.


Upon hearing the sound, the big cat immediately ended its meditation, stood up and followed Zhao Youyou to the center of the yard. Zhao Youyou put the rice down, it walked forward to smell it, and squatted aside.


"Will it dislike Chinese food?" Cheng Yuchen asked.


"I don't know, does it dislike the sour taste of vinegar? Do you think we should pour this out and replace it with something else?" Zhao Youyou felt a little strange and subconsciously took a step back.


Seeing Zhao Youyou retreat, the big cat approached the cat bowl, lowered its head and licked the air twice with its tongue. Its tongue didn't even touch the cat food. The cat queen pretended to eat two bites and raised her head and meowed. Her expression looked like: It's so delicious, thank you.


"Is it performing eating?" Zhao Youyou took out her mobile phone, not knowing whether to check: Can cats not be jealous? Or check: Can cats perform eating?


At this time, the kitten quickly rushed out from an unknown corner, plunged into the plastic box, and began to devour. The big cat raised its head again and looked at Zhao Youyou, as if to express gratitude. Yes, Zhao Youyou was sure that it was a look of gratitude. After expressing his feelings, the big cat lowered his head gracefully and ate with the kitten bit by bit. Sure enough, mothers all over the world are the same. They really take great pains to leave food for their children.


So far, the uninvited guests naturally moved to Zhao Youyou's yard, greeted each other in the morning and evening, and retired after dinner. The cat food bowl next door became deserted, and no cats came to eat.


Since Zhao Youyou met the mother and son, she began to get familiar with the cats in the neighborhood. A sturdy cow cat, with the same color as the mother and son at home, often followed it to the wasteland next to the trash can. Zhao Youyou called it "Uncle". "Uncle" had a calico girlfriend who was always with him. An orange cat was like an attendant, and they would forage in the trash can from time to time. There was also a fat black cat, wandering alone outside the cat group, with an alert look, like a black panther.


The "Cat Gang" seemed to have its own gang rules and their own territories. They occasionally fought in the wasteland and screamed. But at dawn, they gathered in groups of three or two and lived in peace. Whenever she fed bones to the cow cat mother and son, the mother cat would always whimper in her throat. When Zhao Youyou put down the bones and stepped back, she immediately ran up, picked up a piece of bone and ran out of the yard, and came back to eat the rest after a while. Like some kind of tribute ceremony.


In the morning, Zhao Youyou drank coffee and checked emails on the balcony as usual. Although everyone in Greece also uses instant messaging tools, most of the business communication is still done through email. It gives the docking workers a buffer time. An ordinary


matter often takes two or three days to get a reply. At first, Zhao Youyou was not used to it. She often forgot to check her emails, or felt anxious because a certain question could not be answered in time. But over time, she gradually adapted to the Greek style of "late but arrived". After all, how many things in life must be answered? Even if there is no answer and many things are left unresolved, it doesn't seem to matter.


Just after she sent the inquiry email about why the bank card had not arrived, "Uncle" tiptoed into the yard and walked straight to the plastic box where she fed the cat. The mother cat lying on the side saw it and turned her head to look at the scenery. "Uncle" lowered the head of the cat gang leader and ate the leftovers of the cow cat mother and son. At this time, the dog upstairs suddenly barked a few times. Mother Cat turned her head and found Zhao Youyou staring at "Uncle" eating her legal meal.


Mother Cat was petrified for half a second, then she got up and scolded "Uncle" in a low voice, with a stern look. Seeing this, "Uncle" ran away. Mother Cat finished her performance and raised her affectionate green eyes to look at Zhao Youyou, probably saying: I am not familiar with it, I didn't notice this guy coming to steal food, please forgive my negligence.


No matter how good the acting skills are, Zhao Youyou has seen through the work attitude of Zhao's house guard cat who abuses his power for personal gain. Was he fired by the neighbor? She


looked at the cat bowl next door in the distance. The bowl was filled with black and yellow food, and several insects were hovering in the air. They were not picky, Zhao Youyou thought. Judging from this situation, Mother Cat should have resigned from there on her own initiative.


Mother Cat regards order as a god. And her son, the little cow cat, is a carefree person. Instead of walking on a good road, it takes the easy way out by walking on the narrow guardrail like a cat. It slips and falls on the orange tree, but gets up and continues. When no one is around, it jumps onto the balcony chair, lies down comfortably, and basks in the sun with its belly spread out. What's even more shapeless is that sometimes it is too lazy to even stand to eat, and it just lies down next to the lunch box while eating, taking a bite and taking a break.


"It's really Greece, even a wild cat is pursuing Epicurus's idea of ​​sensual enjoyment" Zhao Youyou has never seen a cat that lets itself go like this. But when the mother cat is around, the little one's various weirdnesses will be strictly restrained. The mother cat will drive it off the balcony chair. When it starts scratching the screen door with its claws impatiently waiting for food, it will be slapped to keep it quiet.


The Stoic mother cat insists that "virtue is the only good". It has extremely strong patience and knows how to advance and retreat. No matter how hungry it is, it will never scratch the door, and will not eat before people leave the lunch box. When the kitten followed the uncle to wander around in the wild, he chased it back to "home". It would even lick the lunch box clean and put a leaf or a small flower in it after Zhao Youyou gave them a relatively rich dinner.


"This cat must be doing PUA to us, using this method to motivate us to provide her with better food." Zhao Youyou was skeptical of this goodwill, and Cheng Yuchen said disapprovingly.


"Cats will catch mice and insects to express their gratitude, but I'm not sure about flowers and plants." Cheng Yuchen's science class has always been very rigorous.


"Every time I look at her, she will control me for a while. Sometimes I feel that I am really manipulated by her." The two cats who were lying on the grass mat in the garden leisurely and basking in the sun were probably awakened by the conversation between the two, and they barely opened their eyes and meowed.


"I think you think too much, Mom. They should just be expressing their gratitude." Cheng Yuchen flew the folded paper airplane from the balcony to the yard.


The plane landed on the orange tree, the sun was warm, and the four-leaf clover was swaying gently in the wind. Yes, what else could it be except simply expressing gratitude?


Since when did simple kindness become not so simple? Did it start from the first time she was deceived and hurt? She remembered that there were still a few "old acquaintances" lying in her WeChat who borrowed money and did not pay it back, "like dead". What was more disappointing than the loss of money was that they were originally friends. Not to mention the various games in her past career. She even thought that morality was just wishful thinking of the weak. In the world of the strong, blind belief is an intellectual defect. There are only trade-offs, constraints, exchanges and wins and losses here. She thinks that life is like a game of Chinese chess, full of "containment", "exchange", "forced palace" and "checkmate"!


The so-called roll is actually just a struggle for a certain initiative. When you seize a favorable position, you will not be so easily constrained by others.


She came to Greece to buy a house and apply for a golden visa, and as expected, she was cheated of a lot of money by a friendly and kind agent. The Greek landlord who sold the property came to her door and told her that the house payment he received was only 80% of her payment. The landlord encouraged Zhao Youyou to go to court to sue the agent, but she did not agree. In addition to being tired of the delay and uncertainty of Greek affairs, she was even more unwilling to face the ugliness of people tearing their faces in the face of interests. "After all, they helped me, so just treat it as an additional handling fee," she said to the landlord. The landlord couldn't understand this at all. Traditional Greeks are very concerned about "loyalty" and "brotherhood", but perhaps in the past 20 years of economic collapse, everyone's view of money has begun to become conservative and cautious. Love is precious, but loyalty is more valuable. If it is for the sake of interests, both can be thrown away.


In contrast, the "rich Chinese" who came here gradually let go of their obsession with money. Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the Chinese around them that it is better to do less than more, or perhaps it was the relatively abundant economic situation that brought a relaxed and peaceful attitude. Greece is not indifferent to the world, but it is indifferent to the world because sometimes you can choose to live a less ferocious life here.


Nietzsche said: "You deceived me, but I didn't lose anything. I just lost that I thought you were an honest person." The loss of money can be ignored, but if what you lose is the trust and acceptance of the goodwill of the outside world, then the "bad guy" may really win?


"Gentleness is a top-down emotion." Zhao Youyou said without thinking. "Your words are not connected to the context." Cheng Yuchen complained.


"Look at this cat. Although she is homeless and begging for food everywhere, maybe her spiritual world is far higher than ours."


"That's right, Greek cats may understand some philosophy or something."


The cats seemed to understand what they said, turned their heads together, and meowed softly again.


6. Jewish Neighbors



Zhao Youyou made two bowls for the cat.


Greek yogurt is the best in the world. Classic Greek yogurt is neither liquid nor thickeners are added to solidify it. In addition to using high-quality milk sources rich in high protein, the production method is also unique: it is filtered to remove a large amount of whey to form a thick texture. There is a traditional Greek yogurt in the supermarket that is sheep's milk yogurt in a brick-red earthenware bowl. It has a stronger sour taste and a lighter texture. It is delicious when eaten with honey and bread. The earthenware bowl that holds it is the special cat bowl for stray cats in the streets and alleys of Greece.


For these two bowls, Zhao Youyou ate sheep's yogurt for two days.


"Once you have a cat bowl, does it mean that you have officially adopted it?" Cheng Yuchen asked his mother.


"I don't know if it counts. Who knows if the neighbors have custody of them?" Zhao Youyou is cutting pork fat into small pieces and refining oil residue. Sprinkle a little shrimp skin on the lard and oil residue and mix it with rice for the cat to eat. No cat can refuse this delicacy.


"If the neighbors have already adopted them, why should we feed them?" "For the pride of Chinese food!" Zhao Youyou blurted out.


Question: What kind of people are suitable for emigrating overseas?


Answer: People who can cook.


No matter where you go in the world, as long as there are Chinese people, there is Chinese food. When she first arrived in Greece, Zhao Youyou was in a cooking dilemma. There were no Chinese seasonings. For the sake of animal welfare, Greek pigs are not castrated, and pork often has a fishy smell. After her persistent search and inquiry, she finally got in touch with the Chinese Super League. After all the star anise, pepper, grass fruit, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and native pork raised by the Chinese were purchased, Xiao Zhao's "Chinese Restaurant" was officially opened for business.


Although she only served one customer a day, she was still conscientious and had a variety of tricks. Despite this, her skills were not fully utilized until two uninvited guests broke into their lives. They were not only not picky eaters, but also grateful. Zhao Youyou found a kindred spirit and would spend a little time every day to cook a bowl of cat food for them with great interest.


"What are you feeding them? It smells so good."


There are seven families in the building where Zhao Youyou lives. She usually doesn't interact with her neighbors. Until one day, someone greeted her in her yard with a nice British accent. She squatted on the ground and looked up. A man in his early fifties, wearing a jacket and boots, looked dusty. A friendly smile appeared on his tanned face, and his naughty canine teeth made him look lively and friendly.


"Good morning, I'm a resident on the seventh floor. My name is Albert. I'm from the UK. I'm going to take care of this house and move in recently. Are you a new neighbor? You should see me often in the future." It sounds like Albert is a talkative person.


"Good morning, yes, I live here. My name is Youyou. Welcome." Zhao Youyou stood up and stepped back, and the mother and son cow cats quickly stepped forward and started to rush in.


"They are really crazy about your food. Are you a professional chef? What do you cook?" Albert showed undisguised envy of the cats. Most Greeks can speak English, but they all have some accents. Zhao Youyou is not a native English speaker, and sometimes it is a bit difficult to understand. Albert's English is fluent, and every word is very clear, as if his English level has suddenly improved.


"Yes, I am a professional cat chef. I have a cat food certificate and won a cat food competition award." The chatterbox Albert has a relaxing quality. Zhao Youyou seems to be infected and makes jokes.


"I know, it must be the Ratatouille Rémy who is teaching you to cook, so that cats will not eat mice." Albert followed her words and started talking nonsense seriously.


"In our cat food competition, Provence stew lost to China's Four Happiness Golden Bowl Lion's Head." Albert has even seen Ratatouille, so he must have children at home.


"Will I have a chance to eat this ginger sushi? I can join the cat family for this." Albert obviously didn't know what Four Happiness Golden Bowl Lion's Head was.


"Haha, there is no ginger sushi in China. What I cook for humans are ordinary home-cooked meals. If you don't mind, you are welcome anytime." Greeks are not as enthusiastic about Chinese food as people in other countries, but this British man knows the goods.


"Really? When? I'm asking seriously. I'm Jewish and can't eat pork. I love all other Chinese food." Compared with the relatively conservative and self-sustaining Greeks Zhao Youyou knows, this Albert is really too open-minded. Maybe he has seen a lot of things and the world is one.


"Oh, you ordered the dishes. OK, come to our house for dinner on Saturday night. Ordinary home-cooked meals, don't expect too much." Zhao Youyou thinks this person is interesting. If the magnetic fields between people are compatible, communication will be simple and pleasant.


Early on Saturday morning, Albert confirmed with Zhao Youyou on his phone the time for dinner, whether he needed to bring any souvenirs, and whether there were any etiquettes to pay attention to. He was much more polite and courteous in text messages than in speech, and the British politeness was quite interesting. Zhao Youyou naturally replied that there was no need to bring gifts, and there was nothing to pay attention to,


and so on. She also prepared a menu based on the inventory in the refrigerator and sent it to him, including braised beef, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, Kung Pao chicken, dry pot potatoes, lettuce with oyster sauce, and cream pumpkin soup. Albert probably didn't understand it, but Zhao Youyou was happy to do it.


The beef brisket with snowflakes was blanched in boiling water, and ginger slices, scallions, star anise and bay leaves were added to stir-fry until fragrant, and then soy sauce was added to simmer on low heat. Zhao Youyou liked to add a few peppercorns in it. At first, it was just used to remove the fishy smell of pork, but later she found that the unique fragrance of peppercorns had a unique flavor. In the end, she even added peppercorns to stir-fried vegetables, gradually Sichuanizing them.


Greek tomatoes are well-proportioned and delicious. They are the so-called "old varieties" with a strong sour and sweet taste. The same goes for eggs. There is plenty of sunshine here. All the ingredients seem to have a stronger taste. You only need to beat and fry them until they turn yellow, and then mix the juice from the tomatoes into them. No other seasoning is needed except salt. It is a home-cooked dish that you will never get tired of.


Kung Pao Chicken is a safe dish. Most people who have eaten in Chinese restaurants have eaten it. There will not be too much expected error. Greek shallots have a special fragrance, without too much sulfide taste. Fried peanuts and dried chilies are added. The sauce is mixed with oyster sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, and served in a gold-painted porcelain plate, which is better than the restaurant's products.


Dry pot potatoes are added with fried mint to increase the taste memory point, romaine lettuce is still crisp after blanching, and the secret of cream pumpkin soup is fried soft onions and fried garlic. It took less than two hours in total. The doorbell rang just after the tablecloth was laid. Albert is a sincere man. He really didn't bring anything. He came here empty-handed. Chinese people are rooted in the land and their hospitality is sincere and pragmatic. Jews wander around the world. There is no need to spend money. If there is a reason, they will not spend money. "You said I don't need to bring gifts. I thought it might be inappropriate if I brought them, so I really didn't bring any." Not only that, he also turned the tables.


"We Chinese have a saying, "The more gifts, the less blame." Although it refers to politeness, I can correct it to "gifts." Next time, just bring whatever you want. Don't be restrained." Zhao Youyou said seriously.


"Is it true? Next time, tell me what you need, and I will definitely bring it." Albert also changed his face to be serious.


"Really? I need a hot mama coffee machine, you can bring it." Zhao Youyou has been quite disgusted with her coffee machine recently. The Italian coffee is almost American.


"Hot mama coffee machine, how much is it?" Albert didn't expect Zhao Youyou to really ask for a lot.


"Probably less than 10,000 euros," Zhao Youyou laughed. She actually had one in China before.


"Your dinner is going to bankrupt me," Albert said with a pitiful look.


"It's okay, you can pretend that we don't know each other after dinner, and you don't have to see me off if you don't come next time," Zhao Youyou said as she put the tableware on the table.


"Then I have to eat well today, otherwise I won't be able to eat at all," Albert sat down opposite Cheng Yuchen.


"Mr. Albert, what do you think about the recent war between Israel and Palestine?" Cheng Yuchen heard that Albert was Jewish and had always wanted to ask him this question. China is not like the Western world, except for the United States, where all other countries are condemning Israel. Just like the Russian-Ukrainian war, both sides have their own supporters. Due to their own interests, the so-called objectivity and neutrality of Western online media have disappeared, and the political correctness dominated by the media is violently eliminating different voices. In China, on the contrary, two opposing views can be seen appearing at the same time.


Zhao Youyou didn't expect Cheng Yuchen to ask this question. Although she didn't think this was the best time to discuss such a sensitive political issue, she was very happy that Cheng Yuchen had this curiosity. At the same time, she also wanted to know what the Jews' own perspective was on this war.


"We are fighting a group of devils who worship death." Albert hadn't even picked up his chopsticks when he was confronted with this question. His emotions were all over the place. "Worship death?" Cheng Yuchen repeated Albert's words.


"Yes, they are not afraid of death at all. We just want to rescue our people. All the reports only show that we blew up their hospitals and their children were crying in the ruins. What about our people? They killed our people cruelly from the beginning, including children and women. We want to take them home." Albert took out a military badge from his neck and showed it to Cheng Yuchen. Tell him that the Hebrew written on it means "take them home." Then he asked Cheng Yuchen:


"If it was you, your family, your friends, your compatriots, who were killed or captured by the enemy, would you also save them at all costs?"


"Probably... I think so," Cheng Yuchen answered hesitantly. The material he read was that Palestine was retaliated against badly, and Gaza had been bombed into ruins. But Israel still refused to stop. But when he faced a real person, who righteously said that this was what he should do, he put himself in the role and thought that if he was also involved in this matter, he might also be angry and eager for revenge. If the Chinese were killed and kidnapped like this, he would definitely agree to fight to the last moment. In this way, there is no absolute right or wrong, justice or not in the world.


War is originally a game for the strong, and so is the entire human society. Six million unarmed Jews were killed in the genocide of World War II. After the war, the millions of Jews who survived established a country in Palestine, turning the desert into a high-tech modern city step by step. As they nibbled away at the Palestinian land inch by inch, the Jewish power and the Palestinian resistance escalated into war again and again. Until the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In October 2023, Hamas launched an attack, killing more than a thousand Israeli civilians and kidnapping more than two hundred Israelis and foreigners. In the following year of war, Hamas's base in Gaza was razed to the ground, and more than 150,000 Palestinian casualties.


"How many Muslims do you think there are in the world? And how many Jews?" Albert asked Cheng Yuchen.


"Not sure," Cheng Yuchen answered honestly.


"There are 2 billion Muslims in the world, but only 15 million Jews," Albert said.


This number even shocked Zhao Youyou, who always thought that the number of Jews was far more than this.


"Do you know who has won the most Nobel Prizes in the world?" Albert asked again.


"I know this. More than 20% of the Nobel Prizes in the world are won by Jews," Cheng Yuchen answered this knowledge point.


"Not only Nobel Prize winners, but also Jesus, Marx, Einstein, Rockefeller, Picasso, Morgan, Buffett, Freud, Heine, Kafka... are all Jews."


"And Oppenheimer, Feynman and Zuckerberg," Cheng Yuchen said excitedly. He


had just watched the movie "Oppenheimer" and Feynman's book "The Joy of Discovery.


" "Look, they are all Jews," Albert was beaming with joy, and even glanced at Zhao Youyou, so proud. Zhao Youyou smiled and poured some Fleva from the Peloponnese into the red wine glasses in front of Albert and himself.


"I didn't expect the number of Jews to be so small. You should have more children for the development of mankind, my amazing Jewish guests," Zhao Youyou said as he handed Cheng Yuchen a bottle of Coke, which he opened and poured into his own glass. Zhao Youyou raised his glass and signaled everyone to start eating.


"Thank you beautiful hostess and smart little host, it's an honor to be our guest" Albert and Cheng Yuchen also raised their glasses.


"Thank you for coming, and thank you for introducing the Jews to us" Zhao Youyou said.


"What you just said is right, yes, I gave birth to children for the purpose of propagating the race." Albert said.


"Then bring the children with you next time" Zhao Youyou said politely.


"They are with their mother, I can't take care of them" Albert tried to pick up a piece of chicken with chopsticks.


"Then you can just bring your wife and children with you" This politeness is not over yet.


"Their mother is not my wife, wow, this is delicious" Albert said while eating.


"Is that a girlfriend?" Zhao Youyou bit the bullet and didn't want to talk to death.


"No, we are in a contractual relationship" Albert explained, and he set his eyes on a piece of beef brisket.


"Is it a surrogate mother? Will they be raised after giving birth?" Zhao Youyou took a bite of dry pot potatoes and secretly marveled at his own cooking skills.


"No, we are reproductive partners. We have two children, but she is not my wife. We signed a contract to raise the children together, but we have never had sex. This beef is delicious too." It feels like this guy really loves Chinese food. "What an advanced approach," Zhao Youyou couldn't help but admire. Raising children in a contractual relationship is tantamount to good news for women. "How did you think of doing this?" she continued to ask.


"She wants her own children, and I think it's time to reproduce." Albert used the word reproduction.


"Yeah, anyway, Jewish families have a lot of mines to inherit," Zhao Youyou thought to herself.


"Let me show you a photo of my daughter." Albert put down his chopsticks and took out his mobile phone, flipping out a photo of him and two little girls. One was about five or six years old, and the other was three or four years old. Both nesting dolls had thick black hair, big black eyes surrounded by long eyelashes like brushes, and they were very beautiful.


"Wow, so beautiful," Zhao Youyou exclaimed sincerely, and then said: "Their mother must be more beautiful."


"Hey, how can you talk like that? Although I am a Jew, I am good-looking." Albert immediately found out the sarcasm in Zhao Youyou's words. Zhao Youyou hasn't chatted with smart people for a long time. The kind of humor that reveals intelligence and is completely relaxed is really pleasant.


The meal was a great pleasure for both the host and the guests, and it was filled with knowledge points, humor, and emotional value. After the meal, Albert insisted on helping to wash the dishes. The dishes were full of water, and it was not until after nine o'clock that he finished cleaning up and got up to say goodbye. Zhao Youyou took the leftovers and went out with Albert, chatting and laughing. There were more kitchen waste today, and the two cats in the yard couldn't finish eating them, so she planned to go to the open space to feed the other cats.


As soon as she walked to the open space, the cats smelled the smell and began to gradually close the circle. As soon as she put the leftovers on the ground, the cats suddenly took a few steps back. Zhao Youyou looked back and saw his neighbor Spyros coming over with a large bowl. He stopped not far away and made a "pspspsps" sound in his mouth to call the cats. The cats hesitated for a moment, and as if to confirm each other, they meowed a few times, and finally decided to surround Zhao Youyou's leftovers. In the darkness, it was hard to see Spiros's expression. He put the bowl on the ground. The orange cat that came from a distance to attend the party passed by him, stopped to smell Spiros's food, shook its paw randomly, and then ran to the other cats, shaking its head as it ran, as if it wanted to shake off the smell it had just inhaled into its nostrils. Spiros stood there disappointed.


Zhao Youyou held back her laughter and turned to walk home. The cow cat mother and son followed her all the way back to the yard.


"Rosita! Where are you going?" Spiros called out knowingly.


Rosita? Although Zhao Youyou didn't understand Greek, she could tell that it was a name. So this cat had a name? Was she really the cat mother of the grumpy neighbor? She couldn't help but feel curious. But since Spiros refused to let her go back to her home through their balcony, she had never met him again, let alone spoken to him.


"Hey, Chinese woman!" Spiros shouted angrily in English behind her.


Zhao Youyou turned around and stared at Spiros without saying a word.


"You are stealing my cat!" Spiros said.


"Your cat? Your cat is so hungry that she runs to my house every day to beg for food! Why don't you stop her?" Zhao Youyou was a little unhappy when she heard the word "steal", but she couldn't get angry at this childish dispute.


"I gave them enough food!" Spiros argued.


"Because we don't like the food dad cooks! So we have a lot of food to feed the cats every day." Spiros' twins heard the dispute outside and poked their heads out from the balcony. Constantine loudly exposed his father in English. They were obviously excited about being able to participate in this conversation. At this time, Cheng Yuchen also ran to the balcony to watch, ready to support his mother at any time. It seems that he already has allies, and the battle situation has been formed: 4v1. "Go back!" Spiros shouted at the twins.


"Listen, Spiros, no one wants to steal your cats. If they were yours, why would they come to my door every day asking for food like stray cats? Shouldn't you reflect on what you feed them? Have you taken good care of them?"


"Dad said that the cats like the food he cooks! But I've never seen them eat it," Anna continued to "backstab" unwillingly.


Spiros' anger for several months reached its peak in an instant, and he began to yell at Zhao Youyou: "You should ask yourself what you feed it? God knows what weird Chinese food you made to make cats addicted, and your messy seasonings may even harm their health!"


"What? Listen to what you are saying! First of all, I use all the ingredients bought from the supermarket. If you can't make delicious food, it's your problem, don't take it out on others, okay? Secondly, do you understand Chinese food? Have you tried Chinese food? Where do these prejudices of yours come from? Please don't judge things you don't understand casually, which will make you look less smart." Zhao Youyou was almost laughing out of anger. She had never heard such unreasonable remarks.


"When a person yells, he is actually disappointed in himself." Cheng Yuchen stood on the balcony and echoed. Once, his mother yelled at him when she got lost while driving. After she calmed down, she apologized to him and said, "I'm sorry, son! When a person yells, he is actually disappointed in himself. This is a regressive performance when a person is unable to control the situation. I just showed this animality." Cheng Yuchen didn't know how to say regress in English, and he also felt that the word "animal" was a bit offensive, so he chose a gentler expression.


Cheng Yuchen's words calmed Spiros down a little, and he realized that he was indeed a little unreasonable. The child was right, he was indeed disappointed in himself. The ex-wife didn't believe that he could take care of the children at all. She was like a confident hunter, leisurely in Spain, looking down at his defeat triumphantly. She was ready, waiting for Spiros to admit defeat and ask for help, and naturally took the children to Spain.


"Damn woman!" He muttered, unable to tell whether he was scolding Zhao Youyou or his ex-wife. He felt frustrated about the current situation, but how could a Greek man who had been strong all his life admit this to the troublemaker next door? He turned back to the house angrily. Rosita looked at him leaving with a gentle look and meowed.


Although the uncle is the actual leader of the cat gang, Rosita is more like the spiritual leader of the gang and an old mother in a large family. She reconciles the relationship between cats and humans, not only restraining the behavior of stray cats, but also often casts sympathetic eyes on reckless humans. She has tried very hard to pretend to eat the food of this unpalatable chef, but the portion is so large and the taste is so bad that even she, the Oscar-winning actress in the cat world, can't act anymore, so she has to flee to the next door. She didn't expect that her defection would make Spyros so disappointed...


7. Thanksgiving Island
The circle of compatriots in overseas life is like a wormhole, a barrier, a mini universe. It can allow you to travel through time and return to a familiar life pattern in an instant. Here, everyone speaks the same language, has the same thinking mode and ideology. Follow the same social model and values. It is a miniature China.


In this mini China, people form groups, either doing small businesses together, or going shopping for groceries and picking up children together, or going to classes and fitness together, or singing and playing mahjong together. When encountering things, they ask each other, help to make connections, exchange second-hand goods, bring documents and certificates from home and abroad, one is one, two is two, AA system, and the labor fees to be paid are clear and not a penny less. Sometimes, when you interact more, you meet people with similar personalities and slowly become friends.


Meng Xia is such a friend.


Meng Xia is a girl Zhao Youyou met on a domestic social software. She has immigrated to Greece for six years and often publishes Greek life guides on self-media to attract some Chinese customers who own properties in Athens and help them operate homestays.


When the two met for the first time, Zhao Youyou had just arrived in Greece for more than a month. The two met at the internet-famous bar Lot51 in Zografos. Greece said that the economy was not good, but the cafes and bars were full every day, but a cup of coffee would take an afternoon, and a glass of wine would take an evening. September in Greece was still hot. Meng Xia came wearing only an old man's vest. He had a tall figure, tight muscles, clear lines, and a smooth skin that was tanned and gleaming. His face was extremely flat, with a bunch of tiny freckles on the bridge of his nose, small phoenix eyes and thick lips. Behind him was a tall and thin man with blonde hair and blue eyes. When he saw Zhao Youyou, he immediately smiled brightly at her, with fine lines all over his eyes when he smiled, and a mouthful of neat white teeth like those in advertisements, so beautiful that people couldn't take their eyes off.


"This is my sex buddy, Daniel. This is Ms. Zhao."


Meng Xia introduced generously. Daniel greeted Zhao Youyou politely, then sat aside, turned on the computer and started working.


"He is a digital nomad who followed me to surf the Internet. We can ignore his existence."


Meng Xia asked the waiter to order lively.


"It is said that there are more and more digital nomads in Athens now." Zhao Youyou echoed.


"Yes, if I had known that digital nomads could stay in Greece, I would not have bought that shabby house. However, if I hadn't bought a house, I wouldn't have known that running a B&B in Greece is a good choice." Meng Xia ordered a cappuccino and asked Daniel for a glass of water.


"Do you manage it yourself?" Zhao Youyou asked for a cup of black coffee.


"I hired two cleaners. I do the house maintenance, communication with the property and guests. I can handle the online part, but the cleaning work during the travel can only rely on them."


Meng Xia is talkative and frank. She shared with Zhao Youyou the inside story of B&B agency operation. Generally, the agency operation company will take 40% to 50% of the income. The commission of Chinese agents


is higher, and the Greek agents charge a variety of fees, but the final money is actually about the same. Although it is very tiring to run a B&B, the income is 20% to 30% higher than that of long-term rental. Greek law is very protective of tenants. The risk of long-term rental is that if the tenant lives for half a year, the "sovereignty" of the house almost belongs to them. Tenants can default on rent on the grounds of financial difficulties. Even if the landlord goes to court, the judge will mostly stand on the side of the tenant.


Meng Xia has first-class expression skills, clear logic and detailed data. Zhao Youyou decided to entrust her to take care of her house without much thought. Like most Chinese golden visa buyers, Zhao Youyou paid directly before seeing the house she bought in person. Fortunately, the house is not much different from the picture. Although the location is not suitable for living, it is very suitable for homestay.


After a while, Meng Xia's enthusiasm and frankness and Zhao Youyou's calm and rationality inexplicably matched, and the two changed from a customer relationship to a friend. After all, they were in a foreign country and they didn't have many other choices. Meng Xia looks independent, but every time she goes to Zhao Youyou's house, she becomes a cartilaginous cat, staggering around, doing nothing and refusing to leave. After fighting alone in the wind and rain for a long time, if you suddenly find a corner sheltered from the wind, you will suddenly fall apart and collapse.


"You, make me mapo tofu on the weekend, I really want to eat that," Meng Xia begged while clinging to the kitchen door frame.


"We are going to Andos Island for Thanksgiving on the weekend," Zhao Youyou was cutting onions to make potato soup.


"I want to go too, have you booked a room?" Meng Xia asked,


"Yes, it's a villa, you can sleep on the floor in the living room." In fact, there are three rooms upstairs, and Zhao Youyou teased her deliberately.


"No, I'll sleep with my brother, brother, I'll sleep with you, okay?" Meng Xia was in her early thirties, she called Zhao Youyou sister and Cheng Yuchen brother, completely ignoring the confusion of seniority, anyway, the two were only ten years apart.


"Φύγε" Cheng Yuchen sent out a Greek "go away" from the room "You, my brother chased me away" Meng Xia said, "


You deserve it" Zhao Youyou didn't even bother to pay attention to the two enemies. Cheng Yuchen is usually very polite, but he doesn't treat Meng Xia as an elder at all, and she really doesn't act like an elder.


"When you come of age, I'll take you down" Meng Xia got to Cheng Yuchen's door and gritted her teeth.


"When I come of age, you'll be old" Cheng Yuchen is Meng Xia's nemesis.


Andos Island is one of the islands closest to Athens, and it takes less than two hours to get there by ferry from the port of Rafina. Greece is indeed a world shipping power, with ferries extending in all directions, convenient and fast. Zhao Youyou discovered that Greece has a characteristic: when you first enter its system, you will feel that the management is loose and the process is simple; but when you complete the entire process, you will find that the Greeks' wisdom is also reflected in their complete abandonment of fancy formalism.


She once watched the Olympic torch relay ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium. At that time, there was no guidance at the entrance of the stadium, no staff, no need to buy tickets, and no one checked documents. Everyone lined up spontaneously to enter. This stadium built entirely of marble is simple and grand. No one scrambles for a good seat, and people sit at will. Surprisingly, the unorganized and undisciplined crowd of tens of thousands of people entered the venue in less than half an hour and all took their seats safely. As soon as the performers filed in from the gate, the applause was thunderous.


Maybe this is the Greek style! You can't see the order, but it exists in the consistency of people's daily behavior. Perhaps, those who are committed to maintaining the rules like Spyros are the "invisible big hands" that ensure the orderly conduct of life. The


same was true when Zhao Youyou drove the car into the ferry. You just need to follow the traffic and act according to the instructions. Everyone is not fighting or scrambling, and the dispatcher always strives for fairness. Cars drove into the "belly" of the ferry one by one, and lined up neatly one by one according to the dispatcher's instructions. The same order was followed when getting off the boat. In less than fifteen minutes, all the cars drove safely into the island.


"This island reminds me of Hayao Miyazaki's movies." Zhao Youyou exclaimed as he drove along the winding seaside road.


"Yes, yes, is it "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"? "Meng Xia echoed.


"Andos Island is famous for its strong winds." Cheng Yuchen added from the back seat.


The homestay they booked is located halfway up the mountain. It is a simple stone house. On the barren hillside, the wind is howling, facing the sea, quiet and lonely.


"Are the Canary Islands and Andos Island at the same latitude?" Meng Xia asked.


"The environment here does remind people of Sanmao's home." Zhao Youyou responded


Although Meng Xia is ten years younger than her, their reading and movie-watching backgrounds overlap a lot, which may be the reason why they can get along well.


Before she finished speaking, someone shouted from the bottom of the stairs: "Hello? Is anyone there?"


Zhao Youyou and Meng Xia leaned out and saw two young boys standing at the gate of the courtyard.


"Is there anything I can help you with?" Zhao Youyou was a little alert. There was no village or shop in the middle of nowhere, and people with unknown origins always made people a little nervous.


"Our homestay doesn't have an iron. Can I borrow your iron? I'll be back soon." One of the boys pointed to the two o'clock direction, and sure enough, there was a stone house two hundred meters away from them. The house was made of local materials, and the color of the stone walls was completely integrated into the surrounding environment. If you don't look carefully, you really can't find it.


Zhao Youyou and Meng Xia looked at each other, and Zhao Youyou turned upstairs to get the iron. After the two boys borrowed the iron and left, Meng Xia squinted and smiled: "Hey, pretty handsome."


"In my opinion, they are all children." Zhao Youyou said that children are like the dividing line of people's age. When you don't have children, it seems that you can be a child forever. "They asked us if we wanted to go to the bar to drink together in the evening."


"Haha, I already have children to accompany." Zhao Youyou looked at Cheng Yuchen's room.


There are many disadvantages to moving abroad. You are a minority and a stranger, and it is inevitable that you will be looked at with strange eyes. But at the same time, this is also an advantage. You are scarce and full of charm with exotic customs. From different angles, the conclusion is different.


"Go if you want to go, and be careful." Zhao Youyou saw Meng Xia's intention. It was not until Daniel knocked on the door and woke up Zhao Youyou and Cheng Yuchen that Zhao Youyou realized that Meng Xia had not come back last night.


If you want to quickly master a foreign language, easily integrate into local life, and deeply understand the culture of a country, then find a local lover as a guide. The first opera Zhao Youyou watched in his life was "Madame Butterfly". There are stories about living abroad and finding a local lover, such as "Pocahontas" and "The Last Samurai", and Jessica Alba's film "The Dictionary Lover" is the most straightforward expression of the functionality of this relationship. No matter how romantic and beautiful the movie is, and no matter how love is the final chapter, it cannot escape the original purpose of exploitation. In almost all similar movies, the role of "dictionary lover" is female. They are gentle and loyal. They play the role of victims in this unequal relationship and are simply second-class citizens.


Although she is playing the role of the traveler at the moment, Zhao Youyou will still unconsciously focus on the passive local girl.


Meng Xia is completely different. She has a high degree of self-worth recognition. The generational difference is not simply divided by age. There is a kind of self-role recognition as the boundary. Meng Xia has rich emotions of women, delicate, sensitive, flexible and resilient, but she has almost no consciousness of being a victim, rarely self-reflects and corrects, let alone self-sacrifice.


"It's just getting rid of the dross and keeping the essence." Zhao Youyou once sincerely praised her for this trait.


Meng Xia never persuaded Zhao Youyou to find a boyfriend. She herself went on frequent dates and maintained a purely animalistic attitude towards relationships between the sexes. She did not reject emotional entanglements, but she advocated humanitarian friendly symbiosis and did not want to turn it into a complex and profound relationship between lovers.


"Maybe I'm not that old yet? I haven't received the task card for reproduction and raising offspring, so I don't live so complicated." Meng Xia would explain herself like this. Although she is in her early thirties, she is still a young person who lives for the moment in her self-perception.


Daniel sat in the kitchen, eating the breakfast that Zhao Youyou made for them side by side with Cheng Yuchen. He seemed a little embarrassed. Although Zhao Youyou did not mention Meng Xia's whereabouts, he knew it very well. After all, it was not the first day they met.


Zhao Youyou picked up her coffee and said to Daniel: "I'll go to the yard to bask in the sun, you eat slowly, don't treat yourself as an outsider."


Daniel, a Nordic boy, looks tall and handsome at first glance, like a playboy. But after getting to know him, you will find that he is actually a well-behaved and good boy.


Zhao Youyou didn't want to see him suffer so much, but she was afraid that she would say something and cause trouble to Meng Xia, so she simply avoided talking about it. Cheng Yuchen went back to his room to read after dinner, leaving Daniel alone sitting in the large living room staring at the French window.


The weather in Greece is sunny and rainy, and most homestays adopt a simple and bright Mediterranean architectural style. Because of the dry climate and diligent cleaning, there is no mold or moss in


front of or behind the house. Greeks build houses in pursuit of natural beauty and tend to use natural stone and plain wall paint. Here, you can hardly see the tough reinforced concrete and cold glass curtain wall buildings of modern cities, nor do they have the solemn Gothic or gorgeous Baroque buildings in Barcelona or Florence. At first glance, it may be messy and even rustic. But when you really move into these dry and warm residences surrounded by green plants and full of sunshine, you will feel extremely relaxed. They are truly for living.


Zhao Youyou once discussed this observation with a Greek. She said: "Maybe it's because this architectural style is closer to nature, and people instinctively feel close to and relaxed with nature. After all, humans come from nature." The


Greek laughed and said: "According to what you said, we might as well move to the cave to live. Wouldn't it be closer to nature?"


"Don't say it, maybe living in a cave is really more comfortable and safer." Zhao Youyou joked.


Pushing open the wooden frame glass door of the kitchen, there is a small courtyard outside with a barbecue grill and parasols. There is a small swimming pool under the steps. There are two lounge chairs and a net for fishing fallen leaves and flying insects by the pool. There is nothing else. However, this simplicity is just right. Zhao Youyou often feels that "this is enough" in Greece. It is safe


to go in and out, free, healthy and rich meals, and picturesque courtyards all year round. It doesn't seem to make much difference whether there are other things or not.


Every Greek she knows, when it comes to "weekend plans", either goes hiking in the mountains or goes to the beach to sunbathe. Greece has the longest coastline and the most sunshine hours in Europe. Southern Europeans generally believe that enjoying life is the most important thing in the world, which makes them unwilling to waste this God-given resource. Compared with the Nordic people who focus on a refined lifestyle, Greeks are more focused on relaxing without burden and getting close to nature, and don't care much whether this enjoyment looks elegant or upscale.


"If you still think it's not enough and feel bored, don't you have all kinds of troublesome friends to add some spice to your life?" Zhao Youyou thought when she saw Meng Xia staggering out of the stone house in the distance, and she stood up to greet him. "I drank too much yesterday." Meng Xia raised her hand to block the sun and shouted at her.


"Daniel is here." Zhao Youyou said to her with a smile.


"When I asked him to come earlier, he refused." Meng Xia took the coffee in Zhao Youyou's hand and drank it all, then strolled into the house. After a while, Cheng Yuchen came out of the house wisely, sat by the swimming pool and started playing games. There was a fierce quarrel in the house, and Meng Xia's voice and speed reached unprecedented heights.


"The time when I speak foreign languages ​​most fluently is when I'm arguing. When I'm really angry, I can even start an argument in Greek. I know less than a hundred Greek sentences in total, but I can still argue for half an hour without stopping."


This is Meng Xia's summary of her language ability. She went to university abroad and her English was already very good. But every time she gets angry, she speaks even more fluently. The words and phrases that are usually hidden in the corners will be activated by adrenaline and see the light of day. In addition, in a hurry, she will use her Chinese reserves to achieve cross-cultural humiliation. Even if the other party doesn't understand: playing the lute to a cow, small-minded, frog in the well, short-sighted, etc., a collection of Chinese classical insults, but from the various animals included in it and Meng Xia's contemptuous and angry voice, it can be known that she is insulting herself, and the insult is very serious.


The two quarreled for about an hour, and finally went upstairs happily to have sex. The disagreement between the two sides is whether they are lovers of each other, and whether they can date or even have relationships with other opposite sexes.


The affirmative opinion is: when you are in a relationship with a person, even if there is no clear commitment, it is equivalent to being in a relationship. You can't have relationships with other opposite sex casually.


The opposing party's opinion is: Have we ever confirmed our relationship? Who gave such a strong power to restrict sexual relations? Are you a time traveler from the Qing Dynasty?


After an unsuccessful academic discussion on the time period of the Qing Dynasty and the sexual morality standards of China and the West at that time, the pros and cons reached a consensus: Yes, I still like to sleep with you. As for other things, oh, let's talk about it later.


It's easy to take off clothes in places with good weather. If there are any problems, meet naked, have a deep exchange, and then you won't have the energy to argue anymore. Therefore, southern Europeans are generally more enthusiastic and cheerful than northern Europeans. Daniel, the Nordic ice sculpture, is almost melted in Greece.


The fierce collision of emotions and bodies makes the smell of hormones drift upstairs and downstairs. Zhao Youyou looked out at the azure sea in the distance, and someone once advised her in her mind: "You are single, why do you suppress yourself? Can't you enjoy sex? A full body and mind will make you full of energy and younger."


Perhaps Meng Xia is so full of vitality because of her fully open thighs, haha. Zhao Youyou laughed at her own thoughts. No, no, it's her fully open personality.


She suddenly realized that when she felt funny about open thighs, it was a light and pleasant thought without any critical point of view. Yes, under such a bright sunshine, they have such beautiful bodies. If they don't use them for sex, can they use them for hatred?


Cheng Yuchen ran back to the yard from the swimming pool. The sun was rising, and he could no longer hide in the shadow of the wall. He seemed to have grown taller, and he was calmer and more sensible. However, a child is still a child after all. No matter what Zhao Youyou is busy with, he still runs to her every once in a while, trying to ruffle her hair or tickle her, as if he was using this method to confirm the connection between himself and his mother. Most of the naughty behaviors in childhood have gradually disappeared, but a small part of them are still retained.


A child is like a small tree, and the mother is the seed that nurtures him. In the early days of life, the small tree draws nutrients from the seed. Slowly, the small tree grows its own roots and branches and begins to absorb more water and nutrients from the soil and sunlight. When he has deep roots and leaves and can survive independently, the seed has completed its mission, giving away all its nutrients, and finally only an empty shell is left. This may be one of the reasons why young people today are reluctant to get married and have children: no one wants to be just a seed and eventually become an empty shell with nothing.


Zhao Youyou looked at him silently, and an idea flashed through her mind-otherwise, find a Greek date? Be with a Greek man, learn Greek, understand how to choose cheese, and have someone help repair the sewer pipes, and understand the culture of this country and the lives of ordinary people in life. This is the real "experience a different life!" Not to mention, most Greek men are fit and handsome... Her eyes turned to the Mediterranean Sea in the distance again, the sea breeze gently brushed her cheeks, and she confirmed again in her heart: "Oh, this is a good idea!"
